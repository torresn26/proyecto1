The rain is falling, the lightning is flashing, but it’s all silent. Also, some already existing (but horrible) SFX has been completely dropped out instead of being replaced with better ones. Monsters and skeletons on the first level make no sound at all while walking. You can hear your footsteps but monsters walk silently which looks/""sounds"" really odd.- Keyboard controls are finally fixed, but now the gamepad is not working. Since the keys can’t be reassigned, and the default layout is terrible, the game is (at least for me) unplayable. No gamepad also means sitting in front of my monitor instead on my couch and playing on big screen TV.When at least the gamepad support is fixed I’ll gladly change my review to positive. The game progressed a lot since the original release and is finally (almost) how it should have been from the start. ----Original review:This review is based on the latest version of the game available to me, which is v1.0 for OSX (and I believe it’s also the latest version for Linux). Since the release the developers released a number of patches, Windows only. For a Windows review read somewhere else. I’ll update this as / if game gets updated.From the developers website: ""Slain! is affectionately inspired by games such as Ghosts and Goblins, Altered Beast, Shadow Of The Beast and Golden Axe""Played all of those as a kid. The only thing that\'s better in Slain! are graphics. Everything else is much, much worse. So sad I backed this on Kickstarter, can\'t get the refund. If there was only a bug here or there, I would have hope that it can be fixed. But it\'s not about the bugs here (actually haven\'t encountered any), it\'s about poor game design, really bad controls, missing sound effects… In the games mentioned above there was at least some feedback / knock back when you get hit by an enemy, in Slain! enemies walk through you. Sure, all this can be fixed but it’s not a question of days but rather months. At this stage, I would suggest to the developers to slap the “early access” badge on this and take it from there.EDIT #4:As of 31 May developers ""hope"" they\'ll have OSX (that probably means Linux too) update ”in the near future"". Thanks for the kick in the balls, again. EDIT #3:Hoooraaay! Patch 1 is out! It fixes sooo many things! Oh, wait... it\'s just for Win. No patch for OSX and Linux. But the store page says the game supports OSX and Linux? Well, it also says there are trading cards and achievements.... but you know, who cares anymore.EDIT #2:Achievements are broken. You can get the first one, but that\'s it, the rest of them don\'t work. Store page states ""trading cards"", but they are nonexistent.EDIT #1:Try turning the music off and you’ll find that this game is almost mute!Except from generic footsteps and sword sounds there are no sounds when you pick up power ups, die from spikes, break stones or fall down. On the menu screen you see the rain falling and flashes on the screen (lightning) but can’t hear any of that, it’s all quiet. At the beginning a monster spawns from the ground, blood sprays from the pit, visually very dramatic… no sound… no ground rumbling, no sound of blood spraying, the monster is mute. Fire gargoyles spit fireballs from their mouths… no sound at all.  Monsters make engine revving like sound which starts quietly, then gradually goes louder, then ends abruptly and then starts over in a loop. Skeletons make a fireplace crackling like sound (bones?) but die without making any sound… The list goes on and on. And I’ll remind you all that one of the Kickstarter stretch goals (which WAS reached) was hiring “dedicated professional audio designer”.'}, {'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted May 6.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited May 6.', 'item_id': '91310', 'helpful': '3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'This game is so boring & repetitive, that it hurts.

There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to.Let me tell you about the combat; It is good. My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in.Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different). My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later). Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver. Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced. There was nothing I could do to save him. He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee.The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids. His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear. I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm. Our shields failed at the same time.Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2. Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field. Armour is different. Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core. If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed. Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom. So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core.We tore each other to pieces. I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left. Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines. Now he was more manoeuverable.In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us. Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded. Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score. But it wasn't enough. He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine. Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded.Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear. With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam. In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock.A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void.All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME. If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed. If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off! Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself. Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT. A wing came off? Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it! Enemies powerful weapon came off? Remove your own and replace it!Did I mention I love this game?Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations. I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them. It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with.""}]",-0.9975

In fact hackers have no fear playing this and posting their hacking videos on YT. Developers enforce a 3 day ban followed by permanent ban but are being circumvented by hackers simply changing their names. Glitching has been rampant for a while now, and no actions have been taken to resolve this issue also, which means most people are OP in PvP. There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.I thought I'd be proven wrong by forking out early and getting the GOLD and Season pass, but I regret this.

It's definately no doubt that I've enjoyed a lot with Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the standalone games and the downloadable content.At least for me, I was able to buy the Season Pass of Fallout 4 on its initial price of almost 30 US dollars before Bethesda Softworks suddenly increased the price to almost 50 US dollars for some reason which I don't get.But take it from me, if you are really going to purchase the downloadable content from Fallout 4, it is wise to think ahead first if it's really worth it to consider buying Fallout 4's DLC.""}]",-0.7982

People who think poise was an OP feature for heavy builds, and then the people who thinks it's complete bs.Heavy armor's main advantage was Poise, allowing you to withstand hits without flinching, or slightly so untill you're staggered. Clerics, Sorcerers, Pyromancers and Warriors alike, were all hindered by this change to the 3rd installment.To this degree, you might as well as start off deprived and play through the entire game as is, or atleast use the Master's attire because armor reduction does jack all.I'm am gravely disappointed in Bandai Namco and From Software""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 21, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '58610', 'helpful': '0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""If you were expecting a first person shooter it's not.

Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.With everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I\'m telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn\'t really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like ""Don\'t worry we\'ll get them next time""The Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.I\'ve also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it\'s as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can\'t really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.The soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn\'t like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.There is also Co-op in this game, I don\'t anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it\'s quite nice. Still don\'t know how it works but it looks good.I have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don\'t let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.In conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.........Well what are you waiting for?

That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.Overall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all. Bad is not a word you would describe this game with.

For those kiddies at home new to roguelikes, it means randomised within programmed constraints.Now, the enviornments look great (despite being skinned similar) when you\'re fighting your way through it, it feels cool. But the nature of procedural generation is that the clever placement of enemies is impossible in a game like this. I\'m going to resort to the ""Dark Souls comparison"" thing here, Dark Souls enemies are placed in a genius fashion; they make you take risks and assess your situation. This game just feels like someone had a big box of vikings, giant spiders and robots and went ""WOOPS I dropped them all over my maze, eh, some adventurer will clean them up"". You\'ll never feel like the enemies are using the environment against you, you\'ll never look at a group of enemies and think of a way to get past them. The way to get past them is always the same; run at them and mash attack til they die (Optional: Heal afterwards, but you are invincible anyway (more on that below!))Even in a game like Destiny, you\'re forced to think about what enemy you\'re fighting, and adjust your tactic. But in Necropolis the tactic for every type of enemy is exactly the same; hit a bunch, dodge to the side, or special attack in groups. There is both not enough enemy types and very little change in how you fight them. Even when there\'s vikings, wizards, robots, and skeletons all at once, all you do is hit them til they fall down. The only time they ever change is by health amount (to pretty ridiculous levels of grindy health) and minor reskins. Oh yeah, enemies also never ever block or stop you from attacking, SO GO NUTS.It also bugs me to no end that one of the only things you use currency, which is gems, for in this game is to level up (AKA, get more health), but by level 6 (of 9) you are already max level. So what do you spend the rest of your gems on? You don\'t. You can buy crafting recipes or potions and that\'s it. You will very soon have 8,000 gems in one playthrough that you literally can\'t do anything with.For a game with \'difficult\' on the tags, I expected this to take more than 3 tries playing solo (in my second try, the game just never gave me an armour drop \'just cuz\', so I lost). You have infinite healing items because you can just craft meat to eat, I had somewhere around 50 pieces of meat I could use to craft more healing at the end of the game. And for a game with \'rogue-like\' in the title, I expected there to be more randomized RPG elements. There are four tiers of items; the higher the tier, the better the item, no exceptions. The fact that there\'s so many armour types, but only 4 actual armour classes wastes the potential of all the different sets they hand out. Why not a passive for each armour set? Why, because of the obvious reason; you wouldn\'t be able to figure out what the passive does without reading the wiki because of the ""I\'m a smartass"" goofy text that makes almost every item wholly confusing. I get it; the weapons and armour have been kept intentionally simple so you don\'t sit reading inventory screens for years, but the lack of item variety also effects my willingness to replay it again.The most insulting part about calling it a roguelike is that you are practically invincible! You get a resurrection potion. Yes. A potion where you can keep going when you died. Oh I\'m sorry, did I say A potion, I meant the ability to craft infinite resurrection potions. Which, again, would be less of a big deal if you didn\'t have infinite crafting ingredients on you at all times because every enemy spews out craft confetti so you\'ll never be short on anything but inventory space.I sound a bit salty, because I am. I was really looking forward to this, it had a lot of potential. Do I ever think I\'ll play it again? No, probably not, unless all my buddies end up with it in a humble or something. For $30, you\'re half way to the 40 hour long Dark Souls 3, not to mention all the other roguelikes that you can get for half that price, which offer a lot more content. Sorry guys; it was a good attempt but fell short of what it could\'ve been.'}]",-0.9936

It is true that people buying star forge should consider the fact it is in alpha but that being said, the game itself is barely in a playable state. The world\'s are dull and lifeless, lacking any sort of explorability past the opening area despite the game advertising ""procedural voxel terrain"". The game is set on the premise of a survival game in which enemies come in waves. This sounds pretty standard in theory and seems like an easy basis for a game but StarForge manages to get it all wrong. The waves are slow and tedious, the enemies lack variety and any sort of intelligent A.I and the weapons are dreadful. I have never played a game with gun mechanics as bad as StarForge, they\'re just dreadful.The enemies have basic animations which don\'t show when it is actually in a state of death so you are often left shooting the enemy for prolonged periods of time as the fact is, the enemies animations don\'t show life even when it should be living. You control horrendously in StarForge. Moving, one of the simplest of tasks, is made hard by sluggish movement and bad mouse control. The saturation of motion blur is almost sickening and the lack of any choice to turn it off just makes it even worst. StarForge however does one thing interesting with the movement which is in the form of ragdoll-esque falling. It can provide some laughs as you fly into objects and spaz the hell out when falling but is anything but a good gameplay feature and more of a humerous addition. The games building is a clunky system which like most of the games systems works great in theory but fails to pratically work.  The simple idea of cube-based building is ruined by the games approach to the building system as well as a lack of world modification which seems like something the game needed from the start. StarForge makes a lot of promises and doesn\'t deliver on any of them to the point where writing this review felt more like a winge as I could not think of one thing I liked about the game. One can only hope that in future updates the game gains some sort of solidity but the fact of the matter is that StarForge isn\'t playable by any stretch of the imagination and a lot of work will need to be put in to give it\'s buyers a reason to enjoy it.'}]",-0.985

juego,items,partes y armas,tampoco hablamos de un p2w total,la verdad esta bastante equilibrado,lo que compras con creditos meteor es mas que nada cosmetico  ademas sera dificil obtener creditos hawken(los gratis) pero los creditos meteor estan bastante caros tambien(monto minimo 700 por 5 dolares)ademas pueden comprarse mediante steam como intermediario y no directamente de la pagina de hawken ,lo cual esta muy bien.En lo que se refiere a jugabilidad el juego es exelente,algunos creeran que son muchos controles pero uno se acostumbra no es muy complicado una vez que sabes bien como y cuando moverte,siertamente tienes las de perder si te quedas mucho tiempo quieto, no huyes a tiempo o eliges el lugar equivocado para reparar tu mech.En fin,un juego muy bueno,adictivo y muy atractivo

Within five minutes of exploring and harvesting materials, I was killed by a monster that dealt 700 damage with each attack! I was near the Spire at the time, which I assumed would have weaker monsters surrounding it.Then I had a look at what I would need for a new weapon and some armour, but I found out that the only way to craft weapons and armour was with a material that only monsters drop.I then went in search of a weaker monster, and finally found a wisp, killed it and received only one of the material.

I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title. Hovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles. my oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 24, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '258180', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""terrible port over from mobile platform.I already purchased this game on mobile but I expected it would have be customised and better on pc, especially seeing its an FPS.

I really dont know why it recomends a quad core 2.4gz cpu because the graphics resemble something from the early 2000's and either their rendering system is doing the crysis thing of rendering things that you cant even see, or something else is amiss, but the few servers i did try were dull and uneventfull. im not doing the narrow view thing and comparing to dayz (because frankly i think state of decay is a better zombie survival game) but i just found nether underwelming. dont get me wrong, I liked some of the texture details. and the mechanism as far as encorouging co-opperative play rather than just killing every1 2 steal their things. thats something that sux about most pvp/pve games. rust as an example, great game and well thought out, but most people will kill you rather than work with you to survive. but i liked the idea in this that you have clear reasons why you should work together. and the safe zones are cool. alot to do in there.

Dark Souls 2 não faz parte dessa maioria.Como no primeiro de sua serie o foco do jogo é sobre a maldição (curse), que quando infecta um humano não permite sua morte, mas o ressucita cada vez com menos sanidade e humanidade ate o ponto onde ele fica totalmente insano e selvagem.Centenas de milenios apos os acontecimentos de Dark Souls, Você é introduzido ao seu personagem que esta amaldiçoado, porem, ainda mantem sua sanidade e esta a procura de uma cura, isso o leva a procura por Drangleic, um reino onde se acredita que tenha a resposta contra essa maldição, ao chegar em tal mundo você descobre que nem tudo é como você esperava.Assim como em Dark Souls a historia do jogo é minimalista, para entender tudo é necessario conversar com todos os personagens, ler as descrições de itens e reparar nos visual deslumbrantes que escondem o passado deste reino misterioso. o jogo não lhe apresenta nenhum objetivo, nenhum indicador de onde você deve ir ou algum caminho especifico mas confia em você para explorar sozinho e encontrar seu proprio caminho.O foco de gameplay é seu sistema de combate, simples em primeira mão mas que se torna complexo com o passar do tempo.apesar de ser um rpg onde você pode aumentar status, trocar de equipamento e forjar armas, o jogo aposta mais na sua capacidade de se adaptar aos diferente tipos de inimigos e seus ataques, desde o mais simples esqueleto ao enorme dragão que cospe fogo. a variedade de equipamentos e armas usaveis são mais aproveitaveis ainda quando não se há a limitação por classes ou seja, você pode usar uma espada enorme em uma mão enquanto na  outra desfere magias devastadoras com um cajado, o que balanceia isso é a necessidade de status para que possa se usar com eficiencia essas mecanicas, mas como no jogo não há limite de leveis e você pode relocar seus pontos de status é um alivio para quem não gosta de seguir builds de ponta a ponta. o jogo no inicio te introduz algumas classes porem elas só definem seu equipamento inicial e seus pontos iniciais, elas não limitam o que você pode ser. Seu dinheiro e experiencia são uma coisa só: almas que são obtidas derrotando inimigos ou usando itens, mas há um porem, quando morto você perdera todas suas almas e para recuperalas tera que voltar onde morreu, se nesse meio tempo for morto de novo, adeus a tudo que conseguiu.Os visuais tambem não deixam a desejar, com vistas epicas e inimigos enormes você sempre estara impresionado com o que acontece a sua volta, os minimos detalhes que escondem a historia deste reino perdido são suas pistas para descobrir o que aconteceu, e claro o ambiente, a musica te da uma imersão ainda maior, em um mundo depressivo onde a desgraça caiu sobre os humanos você percebe esse ar gotico e sua orchestra funebreSeu sistema multiplayer consiste em algo unico, cada jogador tem seu mundo e suas ações são independentes em outros mundos porem você pode influenciar outros jogadores com mensagens deixadas no chão ou ate mesmo com poças de sangue que mostram como você morreu, esse recurso é usado para que o jogador aprenda sobre o que vai acontecer e o que pode fazer para evitar. mais influente ainda você pode ser invocado a outro mundo como um fantasma que vai ajudar o dono do mundo a matar os inimigos mas tambem você pode invadir outros mundos para matar seu dono e obter suas almasassim é o sistema cooperativo e PVP do jogoO unico erro é o design das fases que as vezes quebram um pouco da imersão total do jogo e algumas fases que parecem ter sido feitas as pressas pela sua simplicidade, mas nem todas são assimMas o que faz esse jogo tão aclamado? simples. Sua dificuldade.Dark Souls II faz jus ao seu antecessor nesta questão, o jogo não te introduz dicas,marcações,fraquezas ou qualquer outro tipo de ajuda que os jogos modernos nos trazem, ele é diferente, ele confia no jogador em descobrir as coisas sozinhos mesmo que isso signifique morrer milhares de vezes ate aprender um padrão de movimento de um inimigo, não se deixe enganar você vai morrer e vai aprender o quão importante é a habilidade antes de seu equipamentoBonito, Inteligente e brutal essas são as palavras que definem esse ótimo jogo.'}]",-0.7622

First of all, let me start off by saying that Black Ops 3 is a Triple A title meaning that it has a huge corporate funding behind it. Obviously we\'d think that the game would at least be half decent with such a large budget and skilled staff behind its creation. Well, no. This game feels like it had about 10 million dollars in the graphics department and maybe 10000 dollars in the bugs/glitch avoidance, gameplay, story line, and online matchmaking departments. The game is terribly optimised especially for PC and the reviews it got on every professional gaming website/magazine was 100% f***ing paid for! 9/10 on some websites? B*****it! The worst part about this game is the part that everybody wants, the damn multiplayer. Now this has more issues than anything in the game. When you think about the issues with other multiplayer games you think of  things such as bad servers, ping issues, or just bad ping/lag compensation. Well, this game has all of those and more! If you\'re looking to play a game with more than one of your friends then this is definitely not the game you\'re looking for. Around 90% of the time you try to join someone else\'s lobby with more than one person already in it, it starts a s**t storm of errors for you and your friends. Constant error messages saying ""error lobby is full"" (even if you\'re the only one in the lobby) and it might as well just say ""error go f**k yourself"". Matchmaking also brings along a great new feature called ""get screwed over by the same person several times in the span of 10 seconds!"". Now this is a fantastic little thing that COD has added to their online mode and it allows you to be spawn f***ed by the same player over and over again until you just want to Alt + F4. Their respawn system is so insanely broken that sometimes you just spawn in the middle of a bunch of enemies, which sounds great for some people because you can just spray them down but that\'s never the case. Finally this online mode brings a final, new way to be screwed over by anyone you run into because well lets face it, you\'re **t at this game. But hey I don\'t blame you! When you\'re level 1 you\'re constantly being bombarded by a bunch of 4 times prestiged players who have no life or are just really damn good at the game. Honestly, kudos to them for getting such a high level so quickly but at the same time screw you Activision! Starting players can barely start until they\'re around lvl 10 and get a half decent gun with some attachments and by then your KD and Win/Loss ratio is already f***ed beyong repair. So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway. The PC optimisation is absolutely terrible with a bombshell of issues from frame lag to being unable to play the damn game until you have at least spent a solid s***ty night or two getting destroyed by fellow players.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted January 30, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '221100', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'A very good game still a bit glitchy in a lot of ways but with some touch ups it could be an amazing multiplayer game experience.'}]",-0.374

Wasn\'t as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn\'t bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn\'t too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, ""Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!""-pls excuse bad inggris.'}]",-0.9448

It improved and improved as time goes on and has shown me this game is worth keeping.The game is very simple, you are either a Terrorist or a Counter Terrorist.The goal of the Terrorist. To plant the bomb at the selected sites A or B or defend the hostages from  being rescued by the CTAnd the Goal for Counter Terrorist. Defend the bomb sites and rescue the hostages But thats the main gamemode people play which is called Casual. There are many gamemode to choose from in this version of counter strike. The gamemodes other than Casual isDemolition, Competitive and Death MatchGoals for each gamemodeDemolition:  is where you start with one gun and per every kill you get you rank up to the other gun and the goal is to the end of the game is to get the Golden knifeCompetitive: Similar to Casual but stricter, the game is based  on a 5v5 startign with little money and a game that can go to 90 mins. The reason is that it is 30 rounds and the first to 16 wins and 15 being match point.  at 15 rounds the team will swap and the maps are up to you to decide what you want. So for example you just want dust 2 you can just tick dust 2 in your pick of the maps. Team killing is allowed in this gamemode so be careful when u shoot. In competitive you cannot free cam as you can only spectate your team mates and your self for a little bit after you die. The match making is based on your skill level. Unranked is the lowest and the highest is Global elite but dont worry, what rank you are is the systems way of matching players to you Death Match: Death Match is usually the game mode where you practice for competitive because aim is vital in this game. Death Match gives you the option of picking what gun youw want and what Pistol you want to practice agaisnt other players. There is a point system where guns earn you points and guns being selected as random to give you more points if you do get a kill with it.There are many reason why Counter Strike Global Offesnive  differs to other first person shooters. 1 it is constantly being updated, what differs from most fps that they dont usually tweak the game that much but in CS:GO they update regularly. 2.  its a packaged deal, you just buy it and you got everything you need without DLC execpt for gun skins to change the appearance and missions are for ways to complete tasks for a reward of a skin or case in the end. 3 Its cheap. CS GO is very cheap in comparing from the other  main fps titles like Call of Duty, Battlefield etcIn CS GO theres also  some things that most FPS dont havein cs go you have set money and you can earn  through kills and winning rounds to buy better guns in the game either being more accurate or have more damage. Health is also something different most fps's dont have. For example if you are shot in the game you lose health and regenerate like most Fps's right? Wrong, in CS:GO you have a set health with armour to back you up  but if you are shot in the round  you cannot get back the health until the next round.  Hope you love this game more than I and will be fun to see you in CS:GO""}]",-0.985

For those saying its just a glorified screensaver, to each their own. But make no mistake, there is actually quite a bit to do in Mountain.Looking out on the abyss in which your mountain floats is serene. Sometimes, terrifying, if your annihiliation is slowly flying towards you. Yes, it's not as flashy as COD, but I would take this over COD anyday. Just the quiet ambience, and the occasional lone, melancholy note signalling that your Mountain, this huge, hulking Mountain, has thought of something. Sometimes it reflects on the weather. Other times he expresses sadness and memories long forgotten. Controls-wise. Well, the music you can play. You can activate raging firestorms, fish, frogs, hearts, coins, or even blood. It all comes raining down upon your Mountain in a way that can be truly terrifying, engaging, or beautiful. Every now and again, your Mountain experiences a bit of cold weather, and snow comes down upon it, coating your little objects in white fluff. You can zoom in to examine these objects, these stray pieces of someone's or something's life, that come crashing into your Mountain from the cosmos. You can then move these objects, or feel joy/sadness as you purposefully/accidentally send them hurtling back into the void. You can express your distaste at clouds by waving your mouse wildly in defiance.The game is meant to be played when you want. I recommend checking up on it occasionally, but not actively playing if you don't feel like it. Check back if you hear the telltale ping of the Mountain's thoughts.The Mountain is thinking.

Further factions are unlockable following completion of the the Grand Campaign.Total War Kingdoms strongest feature is the real time battles, put a city under siege and send ladders to the wall or attack from afar with catapults, trebuchets and later in the game, powerful canons. Defend your town and cities with a well timed cavalry charge to disable enemy siege weapons and rain down flaming arrows upon the counter-attack.The ability to control each unit individually makes for practically unlimited strategy and the ability to destroy armies that on paper appear much stronger.The turn based city building side of the game also allows for a lot of strategic play, build advanced barracks, archery ranges and stables in castles, and increase revenue by upgrading towns to cities and so-forth.This mode can get a bit tedious in the later game simply because of the amount of organising necessary, but there are options to auto-manage these.Overall the balance between the slow pace of the city building mode and the fast real time battles is such that you can lose hours as your empire slowly gobbles up it's enemies and neighbouring factions. Addictive.The amount of forethought and planning reminds me of chess, in that you need to think a few turns ahead to make the most of your armies.8/10""}]",-0.8591

Watch dogs brings a lot of new and interesting ideas to the table but also has a lot of things that can become annoying after a while. Like the story. At first i really liked the story, but by the end i feel like the Devs just threw everything at the wall to see what stuck and along with that they sequal bait so hard its so ridiculous. Even throughout the game, only a few characters are really interesting, making the story lacking at bestThe gameplay is basically GTA but with a hacking twist. Basically you may use the hacking ability to manipulate the world around you leading to some interesting car chases between the cops. After a while though, the hacking becomes repetative from riding the cameras to just doing basic hacking things. The covers system is also annoying because when i need to get out of cover quickly, My character has a resistance to leave. This is due to the cover latching system. For when your get into cover Aiden latches onto it. Also the game is very short and most of the missions arent very variedThe graphics are okay. While the lighting effects are very good, the rest of the games graphics kinda meld together into a mesh of bland colors and basic texturesWhile the graphics arent terrible they arent worth celebrating.Also the vigilante system is a total pain. If your reputation decreases too much the cops start constantly harassing you meaning that you cant really go on massive killingSprees without the reputation system ♥♥♥♥ing you over. Money is very easy to aquire and doesnt really have a need to worry about your cash supplies. All in all, watch dogs isnt very good. But it isnt the worst game ever. The profiler is very interesting, the gun combat is very good, and while i did complain about the vigilantesystem it does offer a different aproach to combat.

More time is spent in matchmaking than in game in r6 siege.This game is largely unfinished and like many other unfinished games, has been labelled as a finished one.

Occupied by a family just trying to survive. There's one building in particular i'll go into detail on:It's a small suburban house, far away from where the bombardments fell. There are two elder residents living there, with ample food and medicine. you can steal their belongings, so you may live, and they won't stop you. they'll cower and ask that you not harm their respective spouse, whilst all the while begging you to stop and leave them alone. if you come back, they're dead. they starved.

What a waste of that $30 for only 3 hours of game play for such a high rated peice of junk.Where a game such as Infestation: Survivor Stories gets nothing but crap, and I have over 500 hours on it because it\'s not a horrible peice of junk. It\'s had its issues, like every other game, but people just got butthurt and decided they stand by their hatred indefinately. With DayZ, I have had nothing but issues. No way to store anything, so if I die, I lose everything that I have played so many hours to obtain. No possible way to ""trust"" anyone, granted at anytime you can be ""stabbed in the back"". And, last but not least, the environment is absolutely abhorrent, the sun is waaaay too bright, doors are sometimes too small, stairs are buggy at best, movement inside a building is a struggle at the best of time, and I could go on but I\'ll just stop there.So, $15 for I:SS and I get 500+ hours. Double that for DayZ and I get 3 hours, not worth a single set in my opinion, but hey, not that many listen to a ""hater"" of sorts, but behind this hate is an avid gamer who loves to enjoy a good game, and this is not one of the game I enjoy, so it goes into my ""CRAP"" category in my Steam Library.The moral of this story: Don\'t trust reviewers.

This game is by far, one of the best releases Steam has had in a long, long time. If you\'re into survival games, and need something to play that isn\'t the same old crap that is flooding the Steam games page, this is exactly what you\'re looking for.So the game is an ""open-world"" survival, full of dinosaurs, the developers are commited, the updates are many and vast, it\'s quite rare that you see an ""Early Access"" get followed through with by the developers and actually improved, most of them seem to just give up halfway through and stop development. But enough about the development end of this game (High five to the developers though, you\'re fantastic.) Let\'s move on to the actual gameplay and mechanics of this game.To start with, you spawn somewhere on an Island (Future maps are comming out, also a moddable game so go nuts.) with nothing but the underwear covering your ♥♥♥ and a chip in your arm. From there you punch a tree to get wood and thatch, collect rocks, and build your first primitive tool. After that the world is yours, if you wish you can go punch a Dodo in the face and make it your pet (Or if you\'re like me, you tame every Dodo you can find and amass an army to take over the Island. The Dodo King shall reign supreme!). It\'s very much a ""do what you wish, not what you have to"" kind of game. If you want you can climb the Tech-Tree, building newer and better things, but it isn\'t necessary, you can simply go around raiding other people for tools if you wish, or if you\'re smart enough, kill some dino\'s and they drop stuff. If you\'re too lazy for that, go find a cave and run for your life through it until you find a supply crate (Supply crates are drops that land around the world, they\'re always full of goodies.)This is by far one of the best games I\'ve seen on Steam in many many years, if you haven\'t bought it, do it now.

A few days later, I saw this game on my ""Queue"" and decided to go ahead and buy it.The Bureau: XCOM Declassified not only has a hard name to spell, but is also a great game for a prequel to Enemy Unknown and the general XCOM franchise. For the casual gamer, such as myself, this game provides quick-medium length missions which are generally 20-40 minutes, meaning I dont get stuck for hours in game like I do for say Civilizations V or Counter Strike: Global Offensive. If you\'re looking for a casual game that includes a very well-made squad command system that\'s not Star Wars: Republic Commando (Seriously, check it out, its amazing) and you don\'t mind the Third Person perspective, then this game is for you.BE WARNED! This game is not an ""XCOM"" game, quite far from it. It\'s a well made and fairly challenging prequel to EU. I\'ve been playing on Normal, but from what I\'ve gathered via others, Veteran mode is a fairly difficult challenge! Originally you will have some FPS issues if you\'ve got a toaster like myself. Set a couple of the Graphics settings to medium or low and you\'ll be hitting 60+fps in no time! Some of the early levels during this game are ""retrieve this"" or ""save him"" etc. But the mid to late stages of this game make it well worth it. The combat is relatively annoying at first, especially when you face the *******. Spoilers. Sorry. <3. For strategies/tactics I\'ve mainly relied on the Scout/Commando classes, due to their abilities being useful no matter where they are on the map. PROS:- Nicely Paced game that doesn\'t stray too far from what we know and love about XCOM- Agent Carter\'s Hat is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. If it gets knocked off, you can even hit ""e\' on it to pick it back up. Amazing.- Fits in well with the Enemy Unknown Timeline IN CERTAIN PLACES. I\'ll come back to this later.- Nice Combat Mechanics and the Alien AI really knows what their doing- Set in the 60\'s, how many alien games are set during the Cold War/Vietnam War Era??- Squads can be trained up to reach high levels and you can collect alien equipment to arm them!- The Hat.CONS:- Storyline for me so far can be a bit clunky- Some fragments of the storyline dont fit with Enemy Unknown- Total Campaign is estimated at probably 10hrs of gameplay for a casual gamer, but this comes to personal preferance- Squad Commands are a bit hard to get used to- Can\'t keep Agent Carters hat on for the whole game :(Storyline Issues: ***SLIGHT SPOLER WARNING***While I do recognize that the XCOM Saga hasn\'t been known for its whole Lore shizzle whizzle, some things don\'t add up. During the events of XCOM Enemy Unknown, it is stated by Dr Vahlen that they have never seen these aliens before. Hang on a sec, this is set in the 60\'s while EU was in 2015? I realise that Firaxis/2k may not have anticipated that this game would overide their original script for EU. During Enemy Unknown, we must also research Plasma and Laser technology however, I can bring home weaponry that includes both laser and plasma based weaponry to conduct research. Overall, this game started out fairly well with me, but after a while it came out brilliantly. The story revolving around the main character is a bit clunky and doesnt make sense with EU and EW, however I\'d reccomend this game to the Casual/Competitive/Diehard XCOM Gamer who wants a 3rd Person Tactical Game that has the backing of a major developer such as 2k.Overall Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading this if you stayed this far! I\'ve been considering starting a curator page/YT Channel so let me know what you think!P.S: Muton Elites will literally destroy you unless you spam the living ♥♥♥♥ out of it.'}]",-0.9056

Its extremely sad that this game is played in e-sports, as it really is just garbage compared to other FPS shooters such as Battlefield and dare I say it... Call of duty. The so called pros at this game use multiple accounts to keep new comes from advancing in rank, which even if you prove you can out shoot them, they just (switch) cheat with aimbot and wall-hacks and add there hitbox manipulation, so as to hult you from advancing any further. Valve knows this kind of thing happens, so do the e-sports people, but they allow it cause in the end, it creates them money. Like most valve games and community sites, when you try to report these hackers and use names, which is normal when submitting a report, you get punished for making the report, while the hacker remains untouched. Valve will even ban you from community sites for speaking up again hackers, which you will find after playing this game for 20 hours, that it has more then its fair share of cheats and code abusers. You can also report in game, but valve will just ignore it, must like the hackers do when you let them know, you know what they are doing.The ranking system is also complete garbage, your ranked on MVP stars, not actual skill with weapons and encounters, as steam whould have you believe otherwise. The amount of teenagers with mental problems who play this game is also a major issue, as they exist to troll the crap out of you and not play the game, which once again valve not only tolrates, but encourages. Then there is the constant boxed content garbage that forces you to by a 2.50 key just to unlock a skin that can be brought on the market for 50 cents. This is of cause how valve make there money, by making you buy stupid over-priced keys.

The maps looks extremely intresting, while at the same time challenging your skill to survive, as they will constantly have you moving around every corner of the map. The only real problems with this game is that it is still early beta and there are not many weapons to choose from per class, and that after a while the gameplay can feel repeative, which is why I suggest playing the game is short burst waves.PROS:-Great Graphics.-Great weapon look and feel.-Great map detail and design.-Great model detail and customization.-Challenging.CONS:-VOIP needs work-Sound cuts out and drops out-Lack of Weapons per class (it is beta however)-Lacx of current maps with only 6 in total. -Bug incounter: The menu will become inaccessible if you have a Logitech Extreme Pro flightstick plugged into the P.C.

I quickly fould out however that the only thing this game really shares in common with past RPG\'s is the on-screen layout. The first big problem with this game is that it is full of crappy useless lore in that 80% of the lore in this game, is really unrelated to the storyline, other then reminding you of an ability you already have (Reading souls.) This is a big problem because it actually makes it harder to even understand the plot of the game, or will make you either not care for the plot, and can even make you want to quit the game because it just seems like nonsense even for an RPG. The second problem with this game is the game mechanics itself, in which there is only a slight few differances between classes, but not enough to make them feel unique or stand out in the party, For example, the Rogue, barbarian, fighter, monk, and paladin only have about 8 different abilities that seperate them from each other, the rest of their abilites are commonly shared between all classes in the game. Another example is that you don\'t need a Rogue to disable a trap, as any class with ""mechanics"" skill can disable traps, and is available to all classes.The third problem with this game is when experiance is earned, in that combat dosn\'t earn experiance unless you kill a group of creatures for an achivement, like 10/10 monkeys slain. This makes combat useless and really feels like a slap in the face when you spend a few hours slaying a dragon, only to be rewarded with a few ingredients and no exprience points what so ever. The forth problem with this game is the AI, in that your team members will not auto-attack enemies, even when they come running towards your party. Even worst still is that during the end game, enemies won\'t attack you, but instead just stand on the spot waiting for you to kill them. During my playthrough I watched as the Adra dragon was slain by 4 beetles, 3 spiders and a white fox, while the rest of my geared up party waited on the otherside of the map. I killed the final boss of the game without any of my party losing even 1 hp, thats how bad the AI was.This game honestly felt cheap and very rushed. The story made very little sense, and what did make sense felt very bland and boring. the Areas/levels of the game were nothing new and looked average at best. The combat felt like a constant grind. 4/10.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 23, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '234140', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Mad Max explores the typical life of an average Australian.

I mean, the shaky cam gave me a headache, and for the first time in my life I got to experience motion sickness. Once I figured out where they hid the option for the shaky cam (hint: it's in the controls section), I finished the main game in only 3 hours... without rushing.The main story revolves around Kane and Lynch getting together for one more job. Everything goes to hell, and you shoot your way out. That is pretty much the whole story, right there. I wish I was kidding right now.The game was short, repetitive, and for the most part, downright awful. Aiming sucked, the cover-based mechanics were sub-par, and the story was nowhere to be found. The graphics, while alright in some places, were stitched together with overused lighting effects, and what J. J. Abrams would consider to be too many lens flares. This was likely used in an attempt to hide their rushed graphics.They also do this weird thing in the game where they censor headshots... you shoot someone in the head, a big blur spot appears and breaks immersion. If you want to kill a game, this is a good place to start. Was it supposed to be artistic, like the shaky cam?I'm really not sure there is much to recommend with this game, I barely stuck with it long enough to finish it.Graphics: 6/10 (once you turn off shaky cam)Story: 2/10 (Hey, we're shooting people... that's a story, right?)Gameplay: 5/10 (it was playable, not much else)Overall: ... 3/10?

I thought $4 was a good price to pay for it, that it was worth a shot at that price. I was wrong.I should have listened to the overwhelming array of negative reviews. It seems to be using an old Unreal engine, like maybe the Unreal 2 engine or something, and the controls are just awkward. There are slowdowns (for seemingly no reason), long loading times, and this all spells a bad experience without even getting into the poor graphic quality and poor audio quality (yes, I know it's indie, I took that into account).Trying to exit the game after my 47 minutes of buggy playtime was an experience in itself. My system hung on a black screen for around 10 minutes (couldn't even CTRL+ALT+DEL), and my computer was slow for another 10 or so minutes after that with the harddrive being hammered the whole time. It even managed to crash the audio driver in Ventrillo (which I was logged into in the background). The error message said something about too much data being forced through the sound driver.Overall, my experiences with Day One were not unique, and I just cannot recommend this game to anyone.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 27, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '243470', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""As much as I have enjoyed playing Watch_Dogs, I'm not sure I could ever recommend it.First things first, UPlay. Games in Steam need a big warning across the top of the store page if they require UPlay. Why do I need two DRMs to play a game?! Anyway... lets get to it:'Poor optimisation' seems to be the catch phrase for this game on PC, and I agree completely. The first time I ran the game, I clicked on New Game and was treated to a blank screen. After a minute or so of nothingness, I had the game crash, along with UPlay and Steam, all at the same time!Some parts of the game are fun. I love the gang hideout missions (going into a gang area and knocking out their leader), and the stealth gameplay mixed with hacking is great. As I'm sure others have mentioned in reviews though, there are some occasional mishaps with hacking. Sometimes, even though you aim at the person you want to hack, the game decides to blow something up instead.The driving in the game is where most of the poor optimisation shows itself. Apart from the driving mechanics being less than desirable, it can be very hard to drive when the game is stuttering as you transition from one sector to another... or sometimes just as you drive normally. Trying to chase someone in a car is frustrating, and should probably have been removed from the game. You need to either ramthem enough to get them to stop, or hack something in their path to stop them.The story? Well, something happened, someone died, blah blah blah... revenge. It is very cliched and predictable. Nothing really new here, just left over scraps of story rejected from other games.Overall, the game looks nice enough, and there are some fun moments. If you can deal with the bugs, there might be a decent game here. I paid about $20 for it, and I feel I paid for a game that was not ready for release. If they fix the game up, I might be willing to reconsider my opinion. It's hard to like a game when you are constantly frustrated by the game stuttering.

The basic premise of the game is to get from one area to the next, and the main way to do that is with a cutting laser. You basically carve your way through the terrain and hack up large rocks and ancient ruins, while trying to get your 'pants' (read 'underwear') back from Big. Or were they your Grandpa's pants? Doesn't really matter.This game is fun, and very different. Have a look at the videos in the store and decide if the game is for you.

You only have a gun to protect yourself as a gun turret is still being built.

Just make a group with friends please.2) Call of duty would be proud. If you want to keep your rank as a survivor, NEVER,AND I MEAN NEVER GET HOOKED. Once you are placed on it, get ready to say bye to that rank point cause your about to have a sleep over with the killer, he will just sit at your feet till you're dead or some random thinks that the killer is afk and trys to save you, getting knocked out cold.3) Now watch me rank, now watch me de-rank. Now this part of my rant personaly makes me rage. The ranking system. Simple, if you want to rank, you need three things. A buddy, good internet connnection and luck, cause if you don't, you're in for a ride. to get your rank up, you must survive or kill. But your rank will go down if you die or not kill people, leave a game, D.C from a game (even if the killer has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet), if the killer or all survivor leave before the end of a game, hell even turning on four out of five generators on and escaping will (yes that did happen), and completing all the task at hand while your team mate sit in the bushes that end up getting you killed while they get escape because they don't care to help you or the camper killer is setting up for the night.This is only a few thing i don't like, but don't take my word on it.

The first game was great but never realised its full potential. The second game prove to out perform the first and is regarded as a high for the series. This makes the thrid game in the arkham series 'Origin', to be very similar to Assassins creed brotherhood. Although it couldn't be said that these are worst than thier predecessor, neither of these games really offer any ground breaking innovation to the series. let's break Arkham origins down game down into some key compenets and compare it arkham city.Firstly the environment, The Map in Arkham origins is considerably larger than in arkham city , giving you access to what is apparently the whole of Gotham City. Despite its size however its a pretty dull map. one third of the map looks like it has been commped and pasted from Arkham city, another third consistes of a collosal bridge which you have to cross every time you want to get to the other halve of gotham, unless you use the new 'quick travel system'. This leaves only one third of the map that is new, which is fairly dissapointing. The developers have added the bat cave, however this only serves as an access point to ranked challenges and training exercises and you only interact with in a couple times in the main campaign.Speaking of the main campaign, the story line of Arkham origins is as expected top notch. The only criticism I can think of has  to do with some of the villian. firstly some of them are rather obscure. I know some die-hard batman fans will know who some of they are, but if the majority of people have to wikipedia half of the villians in a batman game, it means your scraping the bottom of the barrel. Secondly you only fight most the villians once and then thats it. Deathstroke for instance was the first of the 8 announced assassins for the game and there was a considerably amount of hype about the fight between him and Batman. They when you get to the game you fight him in one boss fight and then he is totally defeated. These assassins are suppose to be the best in the world and are getting paid $50 MILLION to kill the batman, yet all of them seem to lack the tenacity and motivation to try more than once to kill batman. The reason behind this I believe is because the developers are trying to cram the entire storyline into the time frame of one single night, surely stretching it out to a week or at least a  couple of nights wouldn't kill the plot. Finally there is the combat which for the most part is left untouched and retains most of its inherit awesomeness. The developers worked off the idea that 'why fix something that isn't broken' and instead opted to simply make the combat 'different'. This has ment the implementation of three new mobs to beat up: The martial artist, who is basically a regular mob that requires more countering in order to defeat; The Venom thug, essentially a mini Bane, where you have to disable his venom pack before beating him to a pulp; And finally the Enforcer thug, who act like the Abramovici brother in arkham city only sometimes the have armour which you need to remove, before you take them down. there are also some new gagdets that can be employeed in combat such as the shock gloves and the ability to do two special combo moves, however this only makes the fighting eaiser as this give the player a very easy way to beat all the mobs that are support to make the game difficult. There are also some gadgets such as the remote claw and the glue grenade which are exact ripp offs of the line launcher and freeze grenades, respectively.Yet another similarity that Arkham origins has with Assassins creed Brotherhood is the fact that it is the first in its series to introduce multiplayer. This consists of a 3v3v2 system where two gangs (Jokers and Banes) fight over 3 control point while a third team of Batman and Robin (which is unusualy as Robin is not featured in the main game) attempt to takedown the teams siently, in order to build up an intimidation metre and scare the thugs away. Although this is a fairly unique game concept it is at the best of times glitchy. FPS aspect of the game is somewhat stale and ins't terribly exciting. The matchmaking system is fast to get you into a game, but you often have to wait for the nesicarry 8 people to join before the game starts. Despite the fact that 8 people have to be in the game in order for it to start, there always seems to be two or three people that leave the game while its loading, usually resulting in on team having an unfair advantage over the over. This is particularly noticeable when the super villians become avaliable for either villian team to grab. unless the hero team or the disadvantaged villian team is really good, the team with the most numbers will generally gain access to their teams villians, which are considerably over powered . One game it took my team 4 lives to kill an enemy Joker and I have yet to see anyone successfully kill Bane. There is also a system where you can buy, with either in game or real world money booster backs. This in itself is a sin considering I already bought the game. It is more so a sin when the game suddenly desides to wipe all your statistics including your level, unlocks and purchased goodies!In Final Summation, Batman arkham city is indeed a good game by most standards and arguably it is as good as Arkham City , however it is certainly not any better than arkham city and leaves a lot for the next arkham title to rectify. In my opinion however Batman Arkham Origins is still a worthwhile game with pleanty of the unadulterated goodness that makes the Arkham series of of the best in its genre.          7.5/10""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted August 24, 2012.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Most fun 3rd Person shootier EVER!!!!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 12, 2012.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '8930', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Truely the pinnical of the Civilisation series'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 17, 2012.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '21970', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""don't listen to the narrow minded, cretens who say the game is bad.

Let us compare CSS and CSGO once again: In CSS you had chill, down to Earth people who you could talk to, make friends, learn about the game, etc. CSGO's community on the other hand is full of raging tryhards who flame everyone, even their own team, and act like they're the hot shot who is carrying the team. Additionally, you have a lot of hackers and dodgy Russians on VPNs trying to scam you.Oh yeah, and the ranked system is stupid too because it seems to be completely unable to match up players of a similar skill.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 1, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '220860', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Combine Ecstacy with LSD and there you have it, the development process of this game.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted June 29.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited June 29.', 'item_id': '240', 'helpful': '0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Very balanced and skill-based tactical shooter, it's great.

Check out my channel http://www.twitch.tv/diabzlive to see what I\'m about, and join the conversation about Quake Live at http://www.esreality.com/With the launch of Quake Live on Steam it\'s imperative that prospective subscribers understand the dangers of subscribing to Quake Live.Quake Live has a development team of two people with one supporting staff member. This ensures that their development cycle is slow and suggestions from the community are ignored. The Quake Live admin are also world famous for censoring voices of dissent and employing a fascist ban regime when people give feedback or complaints.As a result, Quake Live is a stripped down version of Quake 3 Arena (launched 1999).It has no LAN support.It has no matchmaking.It has no anticheat (and cheating is rampant, considering the ease with which people can code cheats for a 15 year old game).Every few months, they repackage decade old Q3A content and attempt to market it to users as ""NEW PREMIUM CONTENT"".I subscribed since the subscription model launched a few years ago. I have been following the development of Quake Live closely as I am a passionate member of the Quake community.I must STRONGLY ADVISE against anyone subscribing to Quake Live due to the lack of content, lack of updates and fascist admin.Don\'t fall for it!EDIT: All of the features and content of Quake Live plus LOADS more can be purchased all for a once off price here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/'}]",-0.9779

Still waiting on things that were promised before the beta was released, features that were fairly basic and should have been in the game. I was content to just stop playing and leave it at that, but then Overkill brought out this microtransaction weapon skin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, despite their insistence that microtransactions would never happen.So now I\'m here, giving this a negative review. It\'s a shame really, because the game was great at first. But then they just got greedy and now we\'re left with this. Before they implemented microtransactions, I would have said, ""At least they didn\'t get as greedy or as stupid as Turtle Rock Studios did with their Evolve DLC"".

los miticos cs 1.6 y css, los cuales jugue en mi infancia, por eso me extraña escribir esta critica.Aspectos positivos:- Gran variedad de armas- La posibilidad de personalizar tus armas (skins, contadores de victimas y nombres)- Exelentes graficos- Exelente calidad de sonido- Variedad de mapas- Variedad de modos de juegoAspectos negativos:- Si bien dije que hay variedad de armas, hay muchas que son inservibles por los nerfeos, lo cual conlleva a que en todos los servers esten utilizando las mismas armas: ak 47, m4 (sus 2 variantes), p90, Desert Eagle y AWP- Que Valve no se haya puesto a trabajar en sus sistemas anti hacking, hay cheaters por todos lados- Comunidad algo cancerosa- Si sos novato, va a ser muy dificil matar en tus primeras partidas, es mas, olvidate de matar a alguien que tenga AWP- Que Valve se haya concentrado mas en los skins- El sistema de dropeo, mas pobre que el de TF2 (una caja por semana)- Que al parecer, Argentina (y otros paises) no existan para Valve, por lo tanto, el matchmaking te lleva a Brasil, y de ahi te sacan (por votekick) si se dan cuenta de donde sos- Los skins solo se obtienen por cajas (dentro del juego, en el mercado obviamente los venden), y las cajas disimuladamente tienen el mismo proposito que un juego de casino.- Los ""pases de temporada"" costumbre estupida que adoptaron los de Valve para sacar mas dineroEs un juego

bien dije que es un desafio para los jugadores veteranos, puede llegar a ser muy dificil para los nuevos, ademas no permite ajustar la dificultad- Armas: su variedad de armas para mi, es poca, no se aleja mucho de las armas de las peliculas de zombies-  Mapas: poca cantidad de mapas, ademas los modos de juego son solamente 2, nmo (objetivos) y nms (defensa)Argumento final: buen juego salvando los

volviendose monotono, ya que empieza a ser todo automatico- El sistema de mejoras te obliga a elegir que tipo de clase mejorar (Asalto, apoyo, y francotirador), haciendo que cuando lleges al nivel 90, no hayas mejorado todas las clases satisfactoriamente.- Que el modelo del jugador sea mas chico que los NPCS.Calificacion: - 6/10.

Honestly, Magicka 2 so far has been a great experience so far, though I am only up to the third chapter. This game continues on with the humor and chaos from the first game and even in single-player I haven't felt a death was unfair or unwarranted, even on the Hard difficulty. That said, I haven't played the hardest difficulty (Bananas) yet. That said, you will probably end up dying a lot if playing by yourself, as the enemies are tougher in this game.The only part about this game that I disliked is the fact that Steam and Ice are no longer their own elements, since the game is built on the same engine as Wizard Wars. However in my mind this is a small price to pay for a release that, so far, is no where near as riddled with bugs.While I have only unlocked a small number of them so far, the new artifacts system allows you to customise your gameplay experience. I foresee myself replaying Magicka 2 more than the first game because of this.TL;DR Magicka 2 is a great successor to an already great game. While it lacks a few things from the first game, the new additions more than make up for the losses.""}]",-0.3331

As much as I wish to appraise this game, it cannot deserve a recommendation by me, the fact that you are so unforgivingly banned from matchmaking is pointless to say the least.

The thing that makes this so frustrating is that, it was the first match back after ANOTHER 7 day ban for similar issues. The fact that they do not forgive the fact that you may live in a woodland area where power can go out every now and again, or the fact that Steam can act buggy sometimes gets it a 3/10 from this CS veteran.2/15/15 Edit: I recieved yet another ban from matchmaking, this times issue was the following; I kicked too many teammates. Let me begin by reiterating that I had just finally gotten back after 2 weeks of no playtime due to internet issues and in this first game, a teammate began to throw the match, I.E. shooting teammates, or shooting in the air around enemies. Yes, someone (Not me) called a vote to kick him and I agreed because he's throwing the match, but appearantly in 2 weeks of no matchmaking play, one vote to kick got me ANOTHER 7 day ban. This is a continued portrayal to CS:GO's broken economy and has dropped my rating to 0/10, how can a game be rated greatly when it prevents all access to competetive players even when there's a fallacy involved?3/13/15 Edit: Another ban to add to this list; this time it's from being kicked too many times, giving me another 7 day, and here's how it happened. The game was a Comp. Office; the CT was whooping our asses so far, yet with me being second top on our team, three of the players who were in a team decided to kick me, because they cannot win. This further proves my thesis that CS:GO is still broken majorly when it comes to matchmaking bans; the utter fact that this game has the audasity (Phonics FTW) to allow things like this to keep happening with no way of appealing to anyone about getting it lifted.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 16, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '4000', 'helpful': '2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'A great game for the imaginative minds of this world!'}]",-0.5367

Beacoup n'aime pas ce jeu car ils ne peuvent le faire tourner sur le ordinateur ou à cause de crash répétitif. Depuis la dernière mise à jour, les nombreux crash ont été réctifié pour la pluparts. Deplus, je trouve normal que pour un jeu de cette qualitée, il faille-t-avoir un ordinateur correct (voir plus). Mon ordinateur est puissant, mais ce n'est pas le meilleur et pourtant, je fais tourner ACU en qualité élevé avec seulement quelques ralentissement au niveau des FPS. Pour les combat, généralement, je met en qualitée moyenne pour plus de fluidité. Certains sites ont été conçu pour améliorer vos FPS et empecher votre jeux de crash. Donc avant de le noter, commencer d'abord par tester complêtement le jeu, pas juste le lancer et publier un éval' négative juste à cause de problèmes de performance. Passons maintenant au jeu en lui même : Les graphismes sont un point important du jeu que je ne peut que remarquer malgré ma qualité graphique moyenne. La carte de Paris à été totalement reconstitué ainsi que les grands monument présent à l'époque (La cathédrale de Notre-Dame, le palais de Versaille, ect) qui ont été refait dans les moindres détails. Le système de coop est aussi un des points qui m'a le plus attiré dans ce jeu : la possibilité de faire les missions à plusieurs, de ce balader dans Paris avec ses potes. Ensuite il a le systeme des armes qui est une grande nouveautée. Nous ne sommes désormais plus limiter à une seul classe d'arme : nous pouvons utiliser une lance, une rapière, un fusil, une masse d'arme ou une hache. Le seul point encombrant est de devoir revenir à chaque fois sur le menu pour changer de style d'arme. En plus de pouvoir choisir entre plusieurs armes, la tenu est elle aussi modifiable, chaque élément rajoutant de la santé, de la portée ou de la discrétion. On peut aussi apprécier le systeme d'escalade qui a été remis à jour, nous permettant d'éviter plus facilement les obstacles de manière assez stylé. Les combats ont eux aussi été améliorer même si ils sont assez similaire à ceux de Assassin's creed Black Flag. Enfin, un des derniers points importants de ce jeu est le scénario qui me plait beaucoup pour le moment. N'ayant pas fini le jeu, je ne peux vous en expliquer les causes sans pouvoir vous spoïler.C'est pour ces multiples raisons que je trouve que Assassin's creed Unity est un bon jeu qui fait honneur à cette saga mythique.""}]",-0.8885

Quem se lembra do game dos meados dos anos 2000 vai se sentir em casa. É divertido relembrar mapas como Dust, Italy e Train e dá até uma vontade de chamar os amigos para jogar em casa.Mesmo assim, é um jogo que mostra sinais da idade: não foram feitas atualizações nem adicionadas novas mecânicas que justifiquem voltar ao game que, em sua essência, é o mesmo de anos atrás. Vale para quem está com saudades e quer variar um pouco da mesmice de jogar “Call of Duty”.• Pontos Positivos •Mecânica continua atual:Não há como negar: “Counter-Strike” é um jogo extremamente viciante. Mesmo quem se afastou do game - seja pelo motivo que for -, vai se sentir em casa. Afinal, pouco da mecânica foi alterado e o que mudou foi para deixar o game mais realista.Um desses exemplos é quando você usa o telescópio dos rifles de precisão, que deixa a tela um pouco embaçada quando o personagem se move.Mas há novidades também, como a interface de compra, que agora é circular - o que facilita e muito a navegação nas versões para consoles. Novas granadas também aparecem, como o coquetel molotov, que dá liberdade para criar estratégias diferentes. No final das contas, a mecânica de comprar armas em todos os rounds favorece quem joga com cautela e estrategicamente.A versão de PlayStation 3 tem ainda suporte para jogar com teclado e mouse, além do controles de PS Move. Já no X360 não existem tantas variações de controle (nem suporte ao Kinect) e o modo de chat em grupo é desativado – afinal isso poderia ser usado para trapaças, e “Counter-Strike” é um jogo que leva muito a sério a competitividade.Novos modos de jogo“Global Offensive” traz dois modos novos: o Arms Race e o Demolition. Mesmo sendo bem distintos, ambos compartilham de um descontraído espírito arcade e favorecem o confronto direto.Em Arms Race, o jogador ganha novas armas ao matar um adversário e passa por todas até chegar ao momento que se vê forçado a usar apenas a faca. São 26 armas no total e vence quem conseguir usar todas elas com sucesso ou quando o tempo se esgotar.Já em Demolition o esquema é o mesmo das missões de explosão, mas em cenários menores e com mais contato entre os times.  Além disso, o jogador só usa novas armas quando mata alguém do time adversário.Em todo caso, essas novas modalidades garantem um fôlego extra para quem é veterano e diversão imediata para quem ainda engatinha no game de tiro da Valve.Visual bonito""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" é muito bonito. É até estranho dizer isso, tendo em vista que a Source Engine, uma ferramenta de 2004, já não faz gráficos tão elaborados como a CryEngine (de “FarCry 3”) ou a Frostbite 2 (de “Battlefield 3”). Cenários como Aztec ou Italy são bem detalhados e divertidos de serem revisitados.Existem efeitos de luz dinâmica e fumaça volumétrica que enchem os olhos e esse resultado pode ser obtido mesmo em computadores com placas mais populares – leia-se: não muito caras.Por outro lado, é notável a queda de  qualidade gráfica nos consoles, principalmente no PlayStation 3, que mostra texturas mais lavadas e com taxa de atualização em 30 quadros por segundo - uma qualidade bem abaixo do que estamos acostumados a ver em jogos atuais.• Pontos Negativos •Poucas novidadesFaltam bons motivos para justificar o retorno de ""Counter-Strike"". Por mais que bata a saudade de reunir amigos para um \'corujão\' em uma LAN House, fica a pergunta: por que jogar ""Global Offensive""?As duas novas modalidades e os mapas inéditos não são motivos suficientes para voltar ao mundo de “Counter-Strike”.  O mais provável é que, a longo prazo, as pessoas continuem jogando o modo clássico de “Counter-Strike” e nos mesmos mapas de sempre (Aztec, Dust, Italy etc.) - e se divertindo como sempre aconteceu nas versões 1.6 e “Source”.A situação é ainda mais complicada para quem joga nos consoles que, além de não poder jogar os mapas criados pela comunidade, ainda corre o risco de ser abandonado pela Valve, como já aconteceu com as versões de “Team Fortress 2” para X360 e PS3.'}]",-0.9268

ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you\'re not meant to feel invincible, if you don\'t take cover you\'ll die, if you don\'t communicate with your squad you\'ll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to, but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you\'re used to them you\'ll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body.The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that\'s saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle. Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get, Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it\'s not so common that it ruins things.At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes. ARMA 3 is a military sim not ""insert FPS here"" don\'t get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is ""cheap"" or a ""noob""  close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.'}]",-0.8761

The things that make Star Conflict different from War Thunder is the different classes and abilities and factions. I will give a brief run down on the classes and factions. The classes fall into 3 major catagories and alot of sub-classes. The 3 main classes that you will encounter is the Interceptor class; which is designed for speed and maneuvelbility, the Fighter class; which is a class that is a good alrounder, and the Frigates; which is designed for Powerful cannons and strong armour. There are also 3 factions that holds all 3 main classes of ships. The 3 factions are: Empire, Federation and Jericho and if you want to go to the back stories, follow this link --> https://star-conflict.com/en/game/storyline <--. There are 15 ranks not including ships that need to be Manufactured. Each rank has differnet ships per rank and the Crew and Workshop options only occur for when you get a rank 4 and rank 6 ship for any factions. There are 2 gamemodes in Star Conflict that are PvP and PvE. PvP is a head to head combat style gamemode for where the pplayer will be given certain tasks, depending on the mission, to either capture beacons, kill the enemy etc. Then there is PvE, which is where the player fights bots throughout missions to receive points. Then there is Syntax Points wihch is what the player needs to upgrade their ships to go to the next rank. And that is a brief run-down on Star Conflict'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 15, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '236390', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Scare the ♥♥♥♥ put of Muffin_Man (my friend) and 'accidently' kill him in a simulator battle just to ♥♥♥♥ him off. i rate 69/21""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 21.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '227940', 'helpful': '0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Its a good f2p game and no it is not pay to win, you just need to be good to get ♥♥♥♥'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 21, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '248860', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'A fun, survival, strategy game which needs your survival instincts to survive everything from creatures, nature, people and yourself as you fight for survival.'}]",-0.9037

I had some fun, but there is a lot to dislike here in my eyes.The big one is the bugs, including save game corruptions, difficulty randomly flying up and down on loads, broken quests (which required a full restart of the addon at one point), broken dialogue (I was unable to use M'khiin after her dialogue broke to the point she kept talking about dead goblins), occasional unresponsive AI, achievements being popped not corresponding to what I had actually done, and a few bizarre crashes. Multiplayer is broken, and mods are the same. One might think these will get fixed, but Beamdog hasn't got a great track record with these things (I've not once been able to do Rasaad's questline in BG1 without it breaking somehow, and this from 6 playthroughs).I also consider the writing sub-par in some areas. Many points in the story didn't hold up, and quite a few characters felt badly written or forced.Some of the new items were kind of interesting, but seeing as they mostly don't carry over into BG2 I can't really see the point, and quite a few items are outclassed by vanilla gear. I am ambivalent toward the new UI, but I do wish there was the option to change to the old one.

Refuge or god, none are safe from Nikandreos' primal rage as he fights to avenge a quite literally god-forsaken humanity.  A suprisingly varied experience as brilliant in aesthetic as it is in satisfaction from start to finish. I do reccomend playing on the harder difficulty on your first playthrough to get the most out of this game. The lower difficulty leaves you with far too many resources and breathing room. You are killing gods after all, prove yourself worthy to walk upon the Olympian summit. One thing to note about this game is that a lot of your learning is done in a heavily autodidactic fashion. Such little tidbits will follow. Semi spoiler alert relating to the specifics of combat. 1: Sweeping an enemies feet out will throw them into the air.2: Hitting them in the head with your swing will do more damage.3: When blocking, you need to aim your shield at the point of which the attack will impact with you. This is particularly needed in the final fight. 4: If you get into a fight with guards around the 'non-combat' areas, either run as far as you can and hide. (The top left of the screen shows you portraits of who you are in combat with, and will fade away if they lose you.) But if you choose to fight, make sure you don't let them blow their horns. They will summon more dudes to fight and can do this endlessly.5: Middle mouse while blocking to do a shield smack, knocking people back and putting their guard down. 6: Stackable weapons durabilities are individual to that weapon. For example, if you have a spear in your hand it's durability isn't shared with the other 4 hidden on your person. 7: When breaking open stuff, if you have the time switch to your fist not to waste durability on weapons. That's all that comes to mind right now just after finishing the game. I would love to see a similar style game but for Norse mythology instead of Greek. It would be brilliant. Absolutely reccomend this game for fans of souls games type combat.""}, {'funny': '3 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 1, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '225540', 'helpful': '2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""I don't have the time to write a full review, but I just wanted to say that this game, by far, has the worst car driving system in any game I've played.

Unfortunately they have not. The core of the gameplay, attacking and blocking the opposition is still broken to the point that the game is not fun, but provides a frustrating experience.It creates anger every time you play it becuase the game field is not fair. Everything feels slow and clunky becuase all the servers lag so badly. Some are better than others, but in the end, those with the best pings will dominate. It is not uncommon to die 10 times and only get 1 kill becuase the lag is so bad. Your actions on screen are not registered and all you end up doing is getting killed unfairly as hits go through your block. This repeats every match, every game.If Torn Banner actually cared about the game, they would have attempted to fix it after all these years instead of making a DLC for it. I cannot recommed this game to anyone, not even when it is on sale as I feel like I should be entitled to a refund. It is not fun nor challenging.

The world is divided into areas, not just countries, each with their own specific traits which will either hinder or help spread your plague, so choosing which area to start infecting is quite important.

Brainbread 2 is a HL mod where you gun down zeds and bandits in objective mode, arena mode or story mode. Easily earn XP by damaging zeds,winning rounds or completing objectives,so as to unlock skills which improve your ability to send the undead back to their graves. However, it suffers from severe issues.-Subpar graphics and physics allow this game to run on potatoes,so a pro for some. -Horrible sound design. Guns sound and act like peashooters, gibbing sounds like someone tore a piece of paper, and considering shooting zeds and bandits make up nearly all the game, these 2 flaws are amplified.-Subpar melee weapons: Theres no satisfication to gain from what feels like whacking a stick into a zombie. Blood spurts and the sound of tearing paper are not terribly exciting, also, considering how easily you get damaged swinging a melee at zeds or bandits, at the very least, give melee a one hit kill, especially for the bigger weapons like the fireaxe.-The maps are always too dark. It's not frightening, it's not horror, its just frustrating,  The environment is too dark to make out whether your shooting at a player or a zombie. The flashlight is utter ♥♥♥♥ by the way.-Hit detection works when enemies are frontally charging you [Cannon Fodder Tip No.21], but when they turn, walk sideways towards another player, a huge amount of accuracy is lost, even if your literally sticking an assualt rifle into their sides.-Great progression system, XP can be easily earned by dealing damage and doing objectives, but it is not so quickly earned you can unlock everything in a few days. It feels nice to slowly upgrade your character into an almighty zed slaying god. However, my willingness to grind xp is hampered by how unsatisfying killing zeds and bandits are.-Horrific PVP. Skills are at least taken away, so you aint overpowered. Deathmatch involves running around maps not designed for PVP, picking up powerups, running at high speeds and gunning down/meleeing enemies. However, apart from your starting pistol, you need to search the map for a weapon, while anyone with an assualt rifle or shotgun will mow you down. More open maps with all the murky darkness removed must be implemented for DM for its fast, weapon searching player gibbing gameplay to work.Elimination is also lacking. The moment a human gets to an area with limited entrances and ammo [easily found], they pretty much win the game. One kill is counted as one point, so zombie kills are easily racked up. Zombies however, have an easy start, killing humans who dont camp quickly.""}]",-0.9947

You are wrong.First, I would like to point out some issues with this game:a) Instead of using your own Steam account to play, you must make a different account, which has caused me and others to    wait for long periods of time just to wait for the non-Steam account to sync with the servers.b) The Main Menu of HAWKEN is very confusing to most new players, because it is filled with lots of advertisments to buy these special packs which is preposterous, in my opinion.c) Your starting Mech looks like a friggin TV with thin limbs and legs, and to customize it (and other Mechs), you must buy some camos and decals with real money. The only other way you could customize it is to change the frame of your Mech,and  all it does is add 0.01% more colour to it.d) The Primary guns in the game have almost identical stats(as of 3/19/14), which make you waste your hard-earned rewards on things that are almost the same as your stock weapon.e) For those gamers who've played fast-paced games such as Loadout, TF2, and Call Of Duty, I would like to say that no matter what Mech that you play as, you will be slow, and it is hard to tell if you actually damaged an enemy or not.f) The HUD that you will be using in the game will make you feel like you're actually inside a Mech, which is actually nice, but if you move or walk, the interface will shake in what direction you're going, therefore making you dizzy and/or distracted by it.g) In the matchmaking of this game, no matter what level you are, you could fight anyone. So what I'm saying is that you could be Level 1-5, but you will fight people who've tested the Alpha Version of this game a long time ago, and they'll show no mercy.Overall, this game has potential, but I honestly think that the devs need to work on almost EVERYTHING to make this game more appealing to gamers who have played countless fast-paced shooters.""}]",-0.4208

All the reviews bagging it are the same you always see- complaints about the ""netcode"" as though they know what the hell they\'re talking about (care to be more specific since you\'re all experts?), complaints that it\'s too similar to previous versions (it\'s a sequel, duh. It\'s meant to be the same game but upgraded and with a new storyline in the same genre), complaints about the differences being gimmicks (if they kept it the same, what then? They need these gimmicks, we want them, it sells games), and individual bugs that only some experience- I\'ve had none. But if you go through the review comments, you\'ll see that anyone who isn\'t having a cry is saying it\'s the best CoD yet. I\'ve read this MULTIPLE times on different sites. I\'ve played two hours singleplayer and 4.6 hours multiplayer without a break today. It\'s a good game! I had a good time! If you\'re sick of CoD, you wont like it because it\'s CoD, but if you want MORE CoD but with a different flavour, this is a fun and refreshing change to the franchise.

I went to EB games with $70 to spare. I was looking through the isle when this light caught my eye, it was a holy light, a light of which I\'d never seen before. As I approached I could hear a choir of angels singing, filling my soul with righteous temptations. Temptations to mod, temptations to fight dragons and slay the evil of some far away place. When I touchd it I knew, I knew that this had been crafted by the gods themselves, that was the only explanation for this perfect creation. An angel came down, she told me her name was Aela, and that by purchasing this perfect creation I could see morre of her and be in the realm of the King of Gods himself. She guided me to the counter, her holy light forcing all the unholy corruptions away. When we aproached the counter, I reached in my pocket, and when I looked back the cashier had turned into a dragon! It had scales as dark as night, and red eyes that pierced straight into my soul, and it had Aela! It told me that since it could never see the light of Lord GabeN, it would never alow anyone else to. It took a deep breath, and I thought this was to be the end. But it was not to be, Aela threw me her sword, it\'s holy power guiding the hilt into my hands. I slashed at its neck,it screeched in agony. The beast lunged at me, but the holy power of the sword enhanced my reflexes and I managed to jump out of the way while taking a swipe at it\'s neck. The beast was furious now, it did not expect it\'s prey to fight back. I lunged at the beast, my holy sword easily piercing it\'s unholy hide. It howled in agony, for it new I had one this fight. As its unholy flesh burned, I looked to find Aela, but she was nowhere to be seen. In her place was a note that said""Meet me in the land of Skyrim                                               -AelaP.S. nice beard""I had no idea what she was talking about until I reached to my chin to find a beard. Not only that, but I had grown. Where as before I was a 5\'3, I was now 6\'4 with a majestic beard and ripling muscles.

It has an impressive main story with plenty of interesting and dark plot points. It also boasts a fairly intuitive alchemy system and nice flair of atmosphere. However there are a few things that will put off many gamers. Firstly, the combat system is absolutely dreadful. Many say that the combat is fast paced and enjoyable, but the simple fact is that it is shallow and unintuitive, with the only strategy taking the form of combat stances that either make the fight incredibly easy or impossible. Outside of combat, navigation is a bore with fairly generic environments and middle-of-the-road textures. The character models are constantly rehashed, to the point where the same person will show up in every town. At least five times. The animation quality is so lopsided that its sometimes difficult to tell which decade this game came out. In combat scenarios, Geralt has many high quality animations for his attacks in different stances, however, outside of combat the animation quality is lackluster at best. During cutscenes, characters often walk in slow motion when everything else is moving normally, constant speech animations are reused relentlessly and the animations of other elements of characters are just stupid, such as dwarven beards that have a penchant for jumping for joy whenever Geralt talks.While the main story is very well written and interesting, the sidequests are often no more that fetch quests that require you to run to and fro from areas you have already discovered. This is an example of clear presence of relentless padding and backtracking. As if that problem was not enough, many of The Witcher's quests are time-of-day dependant. This means that to begin and hand in most quests you have to find a campfire and rest until the quest is availible, which will also remove any buffs that you have applied to your character.

It has an excellent, mature storyline that takes some thought to understand properly, expecially the relationship between the northern kingdoms and it\'s rulers. The side quests are fairly interesting too, if a bit poorly directed at times and througout the game is an excellent morally grey set of decisions to make. The game looks georgeous on maximum settings and is very well optimised for pc, even though some of the controls are clearly designed with gamepad in mind. The one major gripe i have with the game is the combat system. The potions and oils and other equipment management are well conceived and the basic concepts of the combat also have great potential, however it required more polish. The full combar rebalance mod made by an employee of CD Project RED helped iron out a few issues, however it still suffered from awful hit detection that caused attacts that should have at missed by more than a metre to cause deaths that feel cheap and frankly make the game a frustration. This is not difficult combat like dark souls that punishes the player for their mistakes, its one that punishes the player for not recognising that if you don\'t roll at least several metres away from an attack, it will somehow hit you magically and kill you. It simply feels like the game is cheating at these points and it is hard to continue playing. When you do get hit, you barely notice, there\'s no sound of impact, no screen indication, Geralt doesn\'t even flinch. The health bar just drops with every strike and you end up seeing the same boring death animation over and over again. Its almost like the developers weren\'t counting on players being hit at all and just said, ""Eh, just lower the health variable if anyhthing touches (or in some cases doesn\'t) the player"". This is not responsive and it slowly becomes infuriating. Don\'t misunderstand, the combat has it\'s moments and can sometimes feel really good, but the simple fact is that the majority of deaths feel cheap, as you feel that it is the games fault, not yours. You simply need to dance around this airy combat to make the most of it. Even so, the game is great. It has so much depth in characters and in customisation that it feels like a living, breathing world. It also has lots of replay value, with 16 different endings based on choices througout the game and branching paths that change the whole quest structure from the first chapter. But is it the rpg of the decade as some people profess, or is it even my game of the year (2011)? The simple answer is no.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 10, 2012.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited October 8, 2014.', 'item_id': '72850', 'helpful': '1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""This game is massively expansive and has a huge modding community that allows for just about any content changes, from graphical improvements to full conversion mods.

From bandits taking on your small party or from high ranked enemy armies, this is all dependent on how you want to play.Maybe you want to be simply a trader just wanting to go from town to town finding the best prices on goods and selling them for a higher price in distant towns. Maybe you want to simply find character NPCs to adventure around the world defeating enemies with overwhelming number using your tactics and small but well skilled/equipped party? Maybe join an army and take on castles? OR make your own army and conquer the world?Or become a bandit, raid small villages, steal their cattle and sell the meat from them?The choice is yours, and you can change what you want to do at any time, but beware of the consequences, as people remember what you do, and might just take up revenge.Now the combat system: It can be quite difficult to get used to, but once you get used to it, you feel like you have accomplished greatness. Pretty much you control if you want to swing left, right, overhead or stab. But this depends on your weapon and if you're on a horse. Some weapons can only be used as a stab instead of a swing while on a horse.I recommend turning blocking to anything other than Automatic if you really want a challenge.In the end I just simply get immersed in this game, and while playing it with auto save, you feel every time you lose a battle, seeing all of your soldiers being killed one by one then swearing to avenge them all one day.TL;DR: Control an army, unique 3rd/1st person melee combat, a open living world.""}]",-0.8978

It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track.

There was at least some difference on 2014.- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why.

Recommended if you want to back the game - for an early access and the price of the game, it gives a satisfying amount of content.Take into account that without a wiki and having only played one playthrough with Broken Lords, my opinion can be argued relevant, but, limited.Straight up for people, like myself, who want alot to play around with - aside from the expensive mercenaries and heroes, there are only 3 unique units per faction. This isn't positive or negative, I just figure it to be something to take into consideration.Endless Legend is great but it suffers the early access. Four big things sucker punched my experience:1. AI is half baked imo.Only one faction (bug people) was tough because it focus spammed units at me, the other factions were a cakewalk considering they were made up of archers or came from a less developed civ.You might overlook this until suddenly all the factions gave up half way through the game, by turn 100 out of 200 turns I ended up capturing all enemy cities with absolutely ZERO resistance.2. Forget about politics. Other factions immediately hate you and demand waaaay too much to become neutral, even when you're about to completely annihilate them (I wished for a diplomatic win).3. Storyline quest bugged right at the end.Bugged as in I met all the, very nit-picky, requirments to proceed, yet it still wouldn't let me (like getting to third base in a relationship, only to give you the middle finger). This is probably just me being Broken Lords and having reached the 200 turn maximum (you can continue after 200 turns so it may have been a glitch). I just consider that if their's going to be a storyline, it should be thouroughly looked over.4. Awkward fighting system.Perhaps the most intended problem. When you choose to initiate moves for your units, they play out the option twice. So say I want my infantry to hold a line and my archers to hide behind it. If an enemy is out of range for my archer, there is no way to tell them to run in front of the infantry, shoot, then run back behind the infantry. More of an understanding if you exp the game, but this is very irritating.Sum it up in a sentence: I loved the game, there was alot to explore in both map and content, but, in its current state the mystery is short lived after 50 or so turns - support the game, but I'll be waiting for extra content to make the current content relevant.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 14, 2012.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Timeless'}]",-0.9272

Sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.The developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfectThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!You dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 6.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '252250', 'helpful': '6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""As long as the devs keep updating it frequently, you can't really not reccomend the game, though I do have an issue, here's how my most recent run went.>Get space heaters and ♥♥♥♥, charge, etc>Nobody is making food.exe>why the...>Plants not growing, light and space heater present>This didn't happen before>People run out of food before they run out of water>Check food maker-thing, nobody is using it>40% of the colonist population dies from starvation instantly>ragequit.exe>logic could not be foundThough the game has really stunning graphics, and is extremely fun.So long as it works.

My setup is an FX-8320 overclocked to 4700Mhz, with practically the same performance as an Intel core i7-4790K. But the game insists in using just 2 modules (2 cores in case of an intel processor) of my 4 modules with 8 threads processor. This is not about the fanboy battle about “AMD sucks”, this is serious, even the new core i7-6700K ( 3 times more costly than my FX) can’t pull more than 45 FPS with a huge graphic card. Also I have a Radeon R9 290X (1040Mhz) that can run everything in ultra 1080p/1440p or medium 2160p. But here I can’t pull more than 45 fps in High settings. That’s not good optimization. People with similar setups (i7-4770/90K GTX 970/980) have the same problem, just 2 cores being used making FPS drops and stutter as a result. I can’t understand why high end graphics cards like the R9 290/X, 390/X, GTX 970, 980/ Ti can’t run the game in ultra at 60 FPS, logic says I should be able run this game in 1440p without problems. Also I have big FPS drops in my huge base in hidden lake, reaching low 30 to 25 FPS. I probably have to be thankfull to run the game in stable 35 FPS (capped with AMD Framerate target control to avoid jumping between 70 to 40 constantly) with nearly ultra settings, but not everyone has a high setup like mine.Edit 27 jun: update 243.9 ""* Fixed significant performance issues with dual-core CPUs"" It makes the game even more ""dual core"" optimized. I detected even less FPS (-20% CPU bound FPS from 30 FPS in my huge base to 26)DON\'T BUY THIS GAME. Also we need the devs to take action in this issue ASAP, please don\'t downvote this because you love this game. I love this game as much as you, but 90% of the people can\'t run this game without editing INI files or having a beefy PC. The game is still lagging.

The aim of the game is to connect all objects together, and you can't leave any untouched.The game consists of 26 levels, each letter of the english alphabet is a level. Each level consists of 25 puzzles. All up you will end up completeing 650 different puzzles. But thats not it, there are also daily challanges with can have from 1 to 3 puzzles, some are harder than others. The game may seem easy at first, but as you get to higher level letters it can get rather challanging. As you get to higher levels you will get harder puzzles, this means you will get more variety of different colours, different grey ones requering more numbers, and a bigger amount of shapes. It can get rather challanging at the higher levels.You can finish the game anywhere from 10-15 hours, but of course it all depends on how good you are at this game. The achievments in this game are quite unique, everytime you finish a letter you will get an achievment which is that letter, so you can spell words and stuff on your profile in the achievment tab things, its pretty cool.This game is pretty cool, its challanging, cheap... what more could you want, my final verdict is a 9/10""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 26, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited December 26, 2014.', 'item_id': '1250', 'helpful': '3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Killing floor was released in 2005 and was developed and published by Tripwire Interactive. There is also a sequel to this game comming out in 2015, there are also various trailors for Killing floor  but talking about that would be going off topic. I will be talking about alot of the game features and you may not have time to read all of it or you might just not want to, you can skip to the final paragraph to read the final verdict. Killing floor is a zombie wave base survival game. You can play solo, or co-op with up to 6 other players. There are 5 difficulties you can play on - Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal and finally Hell On Earth. There is a large variety of maps to play on, and you can also download many more maps on the steam work shop. There are seven different classes you can play as, as you play the game there are different challanges to do for each perk, which when completed will level up your perk. The highest level you can get a perk to is level 6. At a level 5 and 6 perk, you spawn with a weapon unique to the class you as. For example if you are a berserker you will spawn with an axe, where as if you were level 1-4 you would spawn with what everyone else who is level 1-4 spawns with. Some classes even allow you to spawn with a protective vest at level 5 or 6. The seven classes you can play as are the Field Medic, the Support Specialist, the Sharpshooter, the Commando, the Berserker, the Firebug and Demolitions. All these classes play in different ways.The gameplay is based around surviving waves on enemies, and each wave there are more enemies, and at some higher waves better enemies spawn. After a wave is completed you have a minute to a minute and a half (depending on the dificulty) to get to a trader and buy weapons or ammo. You can change the number of waves from short, medium, long or custom. Short game consists of 4 waves on enemies, and then a fifth wave which is the boss wave. A medium wave has 7 waves of normal enemies, and then an 8th wave which is the boss wave. A long game has 10 rounds of normal enemies and then an 11th wave which is the boss round. After you kill the boss on the final round you will be awarded with an achievment (if it is the first time you have completed that map on every difficulty exept beginner) and even if you are dead you will still get the achievment. The graphics in this game are not the best, but these graphics were good for their time, let me remind you this game was made in 2005. You can alter the graphics with various options from the menu which do improve the looks of this game. There are 10 enemies in this game. You may think they are zombies but they are in fact specimens, they are failed experimental clones. The 10 specimens are called the Clot, Crawler, Gorefast, Stalker, Bloat, Husk, Siren, Scrake, Fleshpound and the boss from the final wave - The Patriach. The clot is the easiest of the enemies but has the ability to grab you (unless you are a high level berserker), this can be bad in close quaters situations or when you are being swarmed. The crawler (as you can imagine it crawls) is a small black thing with multiple legs and its main attack involves it jumping at you, making it a hard target to shoot. The gorefast, is a red enemy who has a blade in one of his hands, if you let him get to close to you, he will rage and run at you super fast and he can do some serious damage. The Stalker is a female enemy who goes stealth and strikes you from behind, if succesful it can do alot of damamge. The bloat, is a big fat green/yellow guy and one of his attacks if vometing, this poisons you and deals you damage over time, not a long time but it can still be dangerous, he also soaks up quite a few bullets but if you get head shots on him and can be a quick kill. The husk has a husk fireball launcher (a weapon the pyro can buy), he shoots at you from far, but he still tries to walk close to you, if he gets close to you, he will use his melee attack and hit you. The siren is a female enemy who walks fairly slowly but get close to her and you wont hear the end of it, her main attack is screaming, this muffles you visition and does you alot of damamge at higher difficuilties, she should definity be one of the first enemies you try to kill if you are kiting. The scrake looks like a butcher with a hockey mask, he has a chainsaw and if you get to close to him, he will go into a rage mode and run really fast, he can be really deadly if you dont stun him. The fleshpound is the hardest and most deadliest enemy not including the final boss. Up to three fleshpounds can come at once which is really bad. Fleshpounds are much like scrakes or gorefasts, if you get to close to ther fleshpound he will go rage, he will go from the colour yellow, to the colour red and he will charge at you really fast, he also has alot of hit points. The final enemy is the Patriach, he is also the boss for the final round (other monsters also spawn on the final round while the patriach is healing). He has many attacks, he can shoot a rocket at you, he can shoot is arm gun at you, he can melee you and he can also go stealth (which he does alot). He will be in stealth alot but if you damamge him with a fire weapon you can see the flames moving around in the shape on him, which indicates to you where he is. He has alot of hit points and the best stratgy to kill him is to be the demolition class and place pipe bombs at the entrancers to doors, but make sure he cant see you are he will shoot and posibily detonate the pipe bombs. Co-op can be played with up to six other players, but if you play on modded servers i have seen one with up to 32 players. If more players join the game more enemies spawn and the enemies get slightly harder, but if you want to win some games and are not a very experienced player, i recomend to look for a server and play co-op to get use to the game. In co-op you can share guns with team mates and share money, by share i mean you drop them and then your team mates pick them up. You can not revive team mates so if you die you will spawn at the end of the round. Weapons are class specific, but you can find weapons scatered around the map along with ammo and if your lucky a vest. The weapons you buy will be cheaper if you are a higher level in the class you are playing as. Some weapons have an alternet shoot. For example if you have a medic gun you can shoot uneing the alternate shoot mode and if you shoot at a team mate you will heal them. Or as a berserker with melee weapons you can stun enemies, for exaple you can stun a husk by using the alternate attack. My final verdict for this game is a 9/10. It has amazing co-op, a deep class/perk system, a wide variety of enemies and guns, so many maps, maps on the steam workshop, the ability to play solo, 5 different dificulties, lots of achievments, a challanging boss (on harder difficulties), collectibles hidden within maps, different skins which you can buy or get from achievments, custom servers. All in all it is a great game and i totally recommend you buy it, or atleest watch a video to see if it peaks your interest :)'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted January 9, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '270550', 'helpful': '5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Very fun, very cheap...

In this game you build buildings, assign people to jobs, and expand your civilisation. The game features three difficulties - easy, medium and hard and there are two different landscapes. Before you start a game you can pick or get a randomised seed, a seed in sence is a map seed. The steam workshop is also in this game so you can easily download a large variety of mods by memebers of the steam community.The game starts with a certan amount of banished town folk, a storage barn, and some supplies (amount of these things depend on difficulty).  You must then try to expand/maintain your people so they do not die (which is rather hard). There is not really much variety/progression in buildings except from wooden and stone houses.  In order to survive longer you must build more job specific buildings, and assign laborers jobs there to make the items made there. Unfourtanity in this game the AI of the citizens can be sometimes abit silly, only on rare occations but it is still annoying. Sometimes people just idle and do nothing even though they are assigned to a certan job, or in other cases they are doing anoter job on the other side of the map. This game is hard.... regardless of difficulty, everything is out to get you. There are diseases, natural disasters, fires, and the worst thing of all... food shortages. If you run out of food you are screwed, all your people will starve, and then all that is left will be an empty village. Tornadoes can come and just wiz through your village and just destroy everything. But i must admit, after the first few games, its the same thing over and over (unless you get mods - i recomend you do). You always end up using the same stratagy because it is the best in your opinion. And there is no progression which also makes it rather dull.This game is not bad, but it is not great, its right around the slightly above the middle.

Keep your expenditure to a minimum to save disapointment.Added to this are some really lame quests, rather than them making tricky or stealthy or skilled, just enemies you need to shoot a bajillion times, it gets boring pulling the trigger again and again and again on your nerf gun ......Want a better weapon, no problem the very worst legendary weapon system ever, ties the the most ludicrous levelling system level 100 nope try 5000, this as a scam because you leave your best legendary weapons behind or spend real money trying to keep them up with your level and you will not do it with spending cash when it comes to legendary weapons.TRION pretty much suck as a F2P publisher being way to nickle and dimey, driving players away from the game, needing more revenue, become more nickel and dimey, drive more players away, need more revenue become more nickle and dimey etc.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 20, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited April 28.', 'item_id': '236390', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'Reasonable graphics, not bad gameplay, but problems with matchmaking.Can not comment on what it is like to play when you spend big but that has always seemed pretty whacked to me, like paying to cheat as game feature.Match loadings are much quicker now, the catch the more you play for free, the slower they become, much slower and not for the reason you think but because they are stacking you against a team where more and more players will be 1 or 2 tiers higher than you ie you become a target drone, against planes with better armament and better speed and sometimes better maneurverability.Problem with these games having only a PvP format means they can not set up more interesting missions, where NPC take on particular roles.

Poor visual and game mechanic sync, where certain enemies like thugs reach far more than appearances would indicate and if the visual matched the game mechanic their arms would be dragging along the ground a couple of feet behind them.The idea of extremely weak weapon that wear out at a ridiculous rate and require constant repairs is also pretty annoying, an accepted idea taken way to far.Overall the game comes off as having a rather juvenile sense of humour, making the game more annoying than fun, more of a frustrating struggle than a challenge. A game that you could take years to finish, as you just stop playing rather than putting up with the annoyances and then come back to it months later to continue from the last save before again putting it away prior to finishing it.It's a shame Steam don't offer game refund credits, so you can spend unload games like this and spend it on alternate titles, this game is definitely of money back quality.""}]",-0.1214

But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.The turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.The action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.Overall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well.

Most of the hate comes from the large amount of game breaking bugs, which were not removed quickly enough, though at this stage I managed to complete the game only having to restart twice, both of which were not during the story, and I only need to ""restart from last checkpoint"", and not the entire game. [SPOILER ALERT]  The other reason that this game is so hated is because the marketing hinted at a plot that wasn\'t based around the Joker, and included some smaller members of the rogue gallery as the main characters. Now whilst its not true that some less famous villians are included in this game, its just that the Joker is actually the main villian, along with Bane.  Apart from that, the \'lack of innovation\' in this game is the another reason that this game is hated. Whilst in comparison to the other two Arkham Games, that is true, this game has one huge area of innovation: The Multiplayer. Unfourtunately, this was not the audience wanted, so it was largely disregarded. But in fact, the multiplayer is quite fun, and at the time of writing has an active multiplayer community. This is really what I would have wanted from an Arkham multiplayer mode. Stealth against real people. Whilst I will admit playing Batman or Robin is alot more fun than the thugs, there is an equaliser. The fact that at one point in the game, one player will be able to play as the Joker or Bane. This actually can be really challenging for Batman or Robin, especially if the player of the Joker or Bane is good at the game. Of course there is one bug that *still* hasn\'t been fixed is multiplayer data being wiped. Though by launching the game from singleplayer mode this will prevent this bug, no matter what (from my experience). Some may also have to launch singleplayer again one they are finished, but I haven\'t experienced this. Now my favourite bit from this game is the Story. Now, obviously some will be dissapointed (see the spoiler) by the plot, but I still think that the story was gold. It was really the first Arkham Game to try to show the flaws in Batman\'s actions, as he seriously hurts people to stop them hurting others. Some of the corrupt police or common thugs are in desperate positions, and don\'t have much hope elsewhere, yet Batman will still knock them out cold. Still angered by his parent\'s death, Batman is demanding, somewhat ungrateful and unable to listen an opinion other than his own, I cringed with every conversation Batman and Alfred had, until the *incident*. Not a single thank you, shouting because Alfred opposed his views, Alfred\'s relationship with Batman is one of the most heart-breaking of all. The ending was uplifting, and somewhat smart. One pointer is how ubsurd it is how much happens in one night. I\'d rate it 7/10, based on the fact Arkham Assylum is a 10/10 for me.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted March 16, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218620', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'My friend had akimbo pistols as his primary and a pistol as his secondary.

There I said it. This is a good game, it really is as fun as people say it is. However, whoever decided that this version was good enough to release on the PC was clearly not putting in the effort that this game deserves. If you do decide to play it the DS fixes are a must have although they are difficult to install.  I was first tipped off to how bad of a PC port this was when i noticed that the controls posted to do certain things were configured for an xbox. I know that many people play this game with an xbox controller on the PC because they claim it is easier. I play it with a mouse and keyboard. The controls are awkward but not a deal breaker. However, that the controls in your item menu screen are xbox controls and not PC ones for a game of this quality on steam no less, feels like a bad emulator of a game for another system not a professional release.That is just minor stuff though. This is the big kicker for me: the lag, oh the lag. The lag makes it so that randomly your game will freeze even in offline mode and force you to shutdown the program. I can live with that. for a good game, it is worth it. since the game saves every ten seconds this doesnt seem like such a big deal. But, the game does not save during a boss fight. if your game quits out in the middle of a boss fight, you start the fight over. usually this isn't such a big deal, you can fight the boss and beat it between lag spikes usually. However, some bosses, are tanks and they require quite a bit to grind down. This is where the problem is. If you get a lag spike during these boss fights, all your hard work and all the items you spent fighting it are gone. Gone. you have to start over. At the time of writing I have just killed a boss I have had to fight nine times not because i died to it that many times but because each time the game lagged and froze and I had to restart my computer. Moreover, it froze and forced me to quit right after I killed the boss and guess what? Didn't count, I have to fight the boss all over again! I am running it on the lowest graphics setting I can on a good computer to by the way.I would like to give this game a good review. I really would. The enemies are challenging and fun, the level design is fantastic the artwork even on low graphics is amazing. But, sadly the hard work of the developers has been spoiled because someone was too lazy to make a proper PC port of this game. I have heard that dark souls two is significantly better and that it runs much smoother. Good I say, but, I payed for THIS version of Darksouls with the understanding that while not exactly intended for the PC it would function on the PC. what I have gotten is a game that has broken even with numerous patches that clearly needs more work. I sadly regret paying 20 dollars for it and am glad I did not spend more on it. I would like to see this game succeed, I really would but, at the same time I am angry because what I payed for was not what I got. I will probably keep playing it in the hopes that maybe it will work this time but, all and all I am dissatisfied with the minimal level of functionality this game has on a PC.""}]",-0.9807

But that may just be a choice to depict his mental state at the begining. With Davey only coming in about halfway through Coda's game design career, it's understandable the excitement you get from experiancing these new and wonderous creations from a mind that isn quite on the straight and narrow.Coda ensured that everything in his game's had a point, everything appeared done, from the gun that was useless and then skybox where you could see the end of the universe, things were done deliberatly. It's not my place to say that anything was done, or, if it was intended, or, if I could even have any minute semblance of an understanding of how  Coda worked. That's the point of the story. You dont know an artist through their work. Just like Davey when he told people that Coda was depressed, or in a bad state of mind, because of the theme of the little tidbits of game that he created.Coda just enjoyed what he did, and the pressure that Davey put on him, the rush, explains why he slowed down his development, because, Davey couldnt, didnt, wouldnt, understand the demons he had inside of him, his need to be validated through someone elses work. Did Davey put out these works as his own? Did he really add the lamp-posts into the games? You cant know, not unless Davey tells us so, and yet, its only a game.And you Cant know an artist through their works.""}]",-0.8688

Incredibly broken stealth mechanics balanced only by the existence of the cloak.This is very much a game about going balls to the wall crazy, jumping 20 meters into a group of people with an damaclues while having an existential crisis and halucinating 20 foot tall cyberdemons.While someone blows up extradimensional horrors and actual 20 foot tall cyberdemons with a completely inaccurate but amazingly robust mini-gun.At the same time as another person mows down hundreds of hundreds of space terrorists with an insanely high rate-of-fire submachinegun while abusing hilarious autotargeting implants with maximum efficiancy.Entirely in glorius 32 player co-op.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy can only be described as an accidental surrealist genocide simulator that righteously ♥♥♥♥♥ all over whatever gaming convention happens to deter from its appointed duty and firmly cements itself in a niche that very few games manage to do well, if at all.You gain brosouf.My legs are ok.Don\'t download the translation patches they ruin everything.'}]",-0.8525

O jogo proporcionou e continua proporcionando jogos arcades e realistas, agradando os mais diversos tipos de jogadores que tem carinho pela WW2 e suas tecnologias.Porém, em algum ponto desse caminho, os desenvolvedores se perderam e começaram a criar os veículos premiums, que podem ser comprados apenas com cash (moeda nacional convertida para o jogo). Superiores em muitos sentidos, os consumidores dos produtos premiums tem muitas vantagens e podem dominar um campo de combate facilmente. Não bastando isso, as atualizações do modo arcade extinguiram qualquer realidade com os combates de tanques reais, onde um M3 Stuart não consegue andar sem derrapar devido sua alta velocidade. War Thunder teve seu momento de glória, porém eu não vou ser hipócrita e dizer que não jogo mais, pois ainda sou ativo na comunidade. Porém, é necessário perceber que War Thunder está com seus dias de equilibrio contados e em pouco tempo vai se tornar mais um pay-to-win, tornando o jogo que um dia trouxe divertimento a todos mais um projeto abandonado pela comunidade.

If you place a conveyer it costs you $100, and if you then destroy it you only get $50 back, even if you did it right away! If perhaps the game only charged you upon unpausing the game, then perhaps you could go nuts building everything without fear of going broke due to mistakes.I felt like the random elements in the game did not offer enough variability in how you play the game. It's just a matter of looking at the few incredients you have available via the unnecessarily clunky interface, mixing them in the same ways, and producing a product that you then proceed to forget about because it is time to move on to the next product. Then you run out of sockets and just spend the next 30 minutes watching the timer count down and your bank balance go up.This game simply is not for me.

I literally couldn\'t declare war on anybody and if I wanted to leave my federation to take over the other members, I\'d need to wait a 10 year truce...There is a lot wrong with this game, but I think it boils down to 2 main points. The AI is as dumb as a doorknob There is barely any contentThe AI:So often there are AI ships stuck in a system not moving anywhere, even when that empire is under immediate threat. If you click on the fleet, it will show that it is beginning to warp to another system, but then tries to warp to a different one, and it sits there flipflopping between the two. I managed to defeat my first major battle, despite me being severly underpowered, because I exploted this by attacking two systems on either side of the empires main fleet.When you declare war, every other empire within your control (including allys), ""look to you for wisdom"". By that, they turn your highest ""power"" fleet into a deathball by following it with their entire army. This is so moronic that even if the enemies begin bombarding their planets, their main fleet will still follow you around like they are on a leash.Now, this is helpful in some circumstances. You can take out some much more powerful enemies when you have a few empires worth of ships all attacking the same target, but come on, it would have made much more sense to split up and attack some different targets, especially in the end game when you outpower everything.God forbid, if you decide to join a Federation with your Alliance. It works by giving each member a 5 year turn at being leader. They get to choose who to go to war with and what the demands will be in the case of victory. When it came my turn I found myself declaring war on 4 lesser empires just so we would still be at war for at least part of their turn, because in the 100 or so years that I was in a Federation, I think we declared war on two other empires, and had them declare war once on us. In all 3 circumstances, the AI leader would set the demands to liberate a few enemy planets. The problem with this is that the liberated planets still take a lot of work to befriend, so it\'s usually easier to just declare war on them and cede them like the AI should have done in the first place. Liberating planets is literally the dumbest move you could do in your war demands as it just prolongs an already severly drawn out game.The Content:I probably spent 2/3 of this game on the fastest speed setting, AFK, as I waited for things to happen.The first few hours of the game are pretty interesting, your borders are under immediate threat and you have a lot to get done, but after that, basically nothing can threaten you.There are a few quests that pop up, and an alien race will invade at some point, but they are few and far between and even the few that I did get were pretty much bugged and uncompletable.A game where I sit around waiting for things to happen (and I can\'t make things happen because the terrible AI doesn\'t know how to control a federation when it\'s their turn) is not fun to play at all.All in all, this game feels like it should have been early access and given another few months for playtesters to give the devs something to work on.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 8, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '391540', 'helpful': '10 of 76 people (13%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""I can see how the story/character of this game could be fun, but the random battles, annoying UI and save system makes this too much of a frustrating experience.

The worst part is that when they tried to justify the reasoning is that they said it was due to poor match making when it's clearly just the cost of servers vs population. Match making was as bad if not worse after switching off AU servers and latency was significantly worse - actually barely playable in most cases.As such feel free to play loadout it's a pretty sweet game but I don't recommend paying EoR for anything or expecting them to treat their customers in a remotely fair manner.

The second game by the developers following Nitronic Rush.  This game is amazing in so many ways.  From the high speeds you can reach, to the tricks and stunts you can perform and the different game modes.  There is an incredibly detailed and awesome level editor, while the TrackMania series has the title for level editors, this game definetely is up there, with the ability to change light and colour of track pieces and the amount of scenery objects that can be placed.  When I play this game, I am constantly being remminded of Trackmania and how the cars felt when climbing up steep ramps and walls.  This game takes it further by adding in a jump feature allowing for some awesome manoeuvring over gaps and jumping from wall to wall like a car ninja.  For an early access, this is definetely something amazing.  We can all expect that this wil continue to get better with each update.  This is a game I would easily reccommend if they liked the TrackMania series cause they would almost feel right at home.

To make things clear now, just because I played it for a long time, doesn\'t mean I enjoyed the experience of it very much. First off as to why it\'s a poor quality game, is the obvious port problems. They have released many patches and updates trying to fix this but with each one they just bring in more problems that make the game even worse. I will say they have made the frame rate stable (for me at least) and they have fixed almost all the game crashing bugs (can\'t say the same about Arkham Origins). The story in this game, honestly wasn\'t very enjoyable. There were some plot twists that did throw the story around in a few directions but none of them ever lasted. The reveals and deaths weren\'t too effective, and many parts of the story that should have been important (including the Arkham Knight reveal) was basically shoved in your face the whole story leading up to it. Gameplay: Well it\'s terrible in most parts.Pros-The gliding and the overall look of the city is really nice and well done.          The graple controls are nice including the upgrade.          The upgrade system was clear and easy to understandCons-The feel of everything else was just awful. (This is going to be long)You could haer on the police radio that there is a riot taking place in an area nearby, so you can see with detecive vision that there is about 50 or so thugs just smashing stores and trashing the area, so you want to be a cool Batman and jump down and bash all those criminals up. BUT YOU CAN\'T! They all run away except for about 5. It is so sad just watching as everyone runs away and you aggrivate them at all to get their attention so they can turn around and join the fight. Even Arkham Origins did this better with the Crime in Progress system where you can have everyone in the big fights try and kill which was about 20-30 or so thugs. So why not in this game? I want to test my skills against a big group of thugs. Another thing is the Batmobile, I was so excited to hear that you can drive the Batmobile, however when they first showed the design, it was extremely dissapointing, especially the look. The back of it is horrible, it looks like a bug from some angles which is awful. The feel of it is terrible too. Don\'t think I\'m a bad driver because I am quite high in almost every single race event in this game, however it is just awful to drive. The race mechanics are just outright messed up. ""Drifting slows down the timer to make one second in the timer last 3 in the real world"". That is just awful because it means that people don\'t get rewarded for being really fast and driving at high speeds. You will get a better reward (and faster time) for driving really slowly and drifting than you would by doing tight turns and driving at high speeds (and the difference can be up to 1 minute depending on your style). Another thing about driving is the physics. There are many physics problems in this. You can touch a wall which you will normally smash right through any normal time, but far to often, you will be sent flying doing flips in the sky. Ridiculous. And I haven\'t even gotten to the part where they over use the Batmobile so much. *spoilers* they destroy the Batmobile at one stage against a stupid drill machine which is almost faster than the Batmobile itself, and then less than 5 minutes later they give you another one. They can\'t keep it away from you. *end spoilers* They use it for everything. And every puzzle and trap possible just so happens to be only activated by the Batmobile! I will say that the combat challenges in the Batmobile are alright. Not good but alright. They are mostly easy and get very simple very quick. I don\'t put much more than 3 minutes of effort into it because that\'s as much variety as there is and it\'s not worth getting high on the leaderboard. Now moving onto combat. Oh boy, oh boy. This is the biggest problem in this game by a long shot. I can spend hours and hours talking about everything wrong with it, but I wont because I\'ve been making youtube videos to do that for me. The combat is awful and broken and just down right disapointing. I will start with the normal problems that need to be modified (this is excluding glitches). 1. Charging thugs: This was a stupid idea. A thug that runs at incredibly slow speed can only be stopped by a batarang to the face. (Or evade which doesn\'t stop them but avoids them). For some reason a flying kick from Batman to the face is beaten by a man doing a bit more than a jog. It\'s incredibly odd and stupid, and their hit box is far to big. They have a hit box of about 2 thugs wide.2. Camera in combat: It is the worst of the series. It will pan around for stupid reasons even when you don\'t want it to, and the problem with that is that the combat priotisation is based on your camera direction. Also a move you can unlock and perform is the Special Batclaw slam which grapples the target and you fly at him and flip over you and slam him into the ground. (A bit different when doing this to a Brute but the same problem is there) The camera does this stupid movie action look where it zooms in on their torso\'s and you can\'t see a damn thing. Sometimes there is a glitch where that camera shot doesn\'t work and it stays at the distant 3rd person look (and you know you messed up when a glitch makes what you have look sh*t). They need to get rid of the zoom on that move. It cause everyone to step back but it spins the camera as well messing things up for about .75 of a second (and that\'s important). Also the camera doesn\'t do well when near a wall (it might be a glitch so I\'ll explain it in that part). 3. Target Priorisation: This is one of the worst. They have many challenge maps in this game such as the combo master which means you need to keep one combo for as long as possible. I am not bad at Arkham Combat, I\'ve gotten hundreds of thousands of points (millions for some) in challenge maps and I\'ve gotten a nice score in combo master of over 250. Which was good for the first 3 days when it came out and the frame rates absolutely murdered itself when the timer starts on the screen and the frames drop to 1 per second. But now it\'s terrible. Keeping combos for more than 200 is almost impossible. Special moves such as disarm and destroy don\'t know what they are doing. They need a proper order of importance beacuse for some reason, the game seems to think that poles and baseball bats are more of a threat than stun sticks or shields. (Even though baseball bats and poles are weapons Batman can use) Basic Free flow combat has got it wrong also. I can look straight at a thug without anything in his hand, I aim at him, I go for him, but the game decides that the man 3 thugs behind him with a stun stick is the right target to pick which kills the combo and fails the challenge. It\'s just terrible. In one of the videos I\'m making, I will be including a full length statement including how priotisation and the combat should be working to make things good again. There is more but I will move onto the glitches.Camera against walls: Combo challenge is a perfect example. There isn\'t a proper boundary in that challenge, it just some purple walls that fizzle which used to murder frame rates right? Well for some reason the camera glitches like crazy when you try and look behind you when punching someone against those walls. Those walls need to let the camera go through them at least cause it messes so much up. Counters: They are broken as hell. I get so many instances where a thug wants to attack so me so I counter, but they just freeze and don\'t attack and Batman doesn\'t move so it drops the combo. You can\'t do anything but watch for one second as nothing happens and watch your chance of getting a high score vanish. These need to fixed because they cause extreme game impacting problems. I have run out of room for this review. Don\'t buy.

No game has dones something like this before and had the risk of majorly failing.  Coffee Stains studios did extremely well in their game.  They've put so much detail into every map and enemy.  Coming from their first Sanctum, they really kept it up.  Even though there are big changes, it will still feel like the first one.  Both games rely heavily on your strategies.  There are multiple ways to beat the level but there are always those setups that beat every other.  I have to say, Co-op is where this really gets the fame and attention it has.  Playing a normal Tower Defence, you are by yourself, just watching things happen.  Sanctum solo makes you feel pretty awesome as you are taking down waves after waves.  But when the co-op starts, things get much better.  You and your friends will be jumping all over the map blasting enemies to pieces and having a great time.  I have played a lot more solo than I have co-op but I definetely like Co-op more.  You get more people to with resources to build your towers, two extra guns and 3 perks to switch with.  The choice of perks and weapons and towers are very important.  You don't want to take an Anti-Air tower into a map with no flying units (that's a wasted tower), and you don't want a perk that gives you speed increase if it's a map where you don't even need to run and you can stay still the whole time.  There are perks and weapons for almost every kind of play style, from cover sniper, to rocket launcher madman and your classic assault.  Downsides: Difficulty is random as the story continues.  And I don't mean if you do well on one level it suddenly gets hard.  I mean that you can be going through easy levels, then the next 2 are extremely hard and it gives no warning, suddenly gets hard then drops back down.  It will cause frustration but there is a restart button if you get stuck.  Lag:  I know this isn't the game's fault but if you are playing with someone and one of you has lag or gets a random lag spike, it really downs the game and makes it impossible to play properly.  If lag is an issue for you, stay away from Co-opTroll weapons:  I'm serious, there are some weapons in the game that look like they have been made for trolling other players.  They have serious knockback and will p*ss people off a lot.  It sends the person being shot flying and knocking them off the map in the middle of a big fight.  This is one of my favourite games because it's just works brilliantly in so many ways.  There are more things I should talk about such as how great the game looks and the little minigames featured, but I won't.

Then a German soldier just started yelling out stuff saying ""I know you\'re there!"". I immediately backed away, but this guy didn\'t even need to find me, he knows exactly where I am. He knows I killed his mate and he knows exactly, where the shots came from. As soon as he found the dead body of his mate, he faced right and immediately started firing, me getting scared from his taunts and sudden shots, pulled the trigger (I even accidentally pushed my mouse up, so I had to re-aim) and suprisingly killed him after emptying my clip.

For the record I'm playing in the Oceanic region, so if you're not from there these issues may not apply to you. Positives:-interesting take on multiplayer-diverse character roster with different traits and skills-reasonably priced (not a $100 dollars for a multiplayer only experience *cough* Titanfall *cough*)-fair progression system (big surprise coming from Ubisoft instead of being locked behind a micro-transaction)-solid gunplay and action-strong focus on teamwork (choose not to respect this, and prepare to get your ♥♥♥ kicked)-decent variety in scenarios and maps which cleverly blends the two aspects-genuine tense moments Negatives (brace yourselves this may get lengthy):-clunky matchmaking (this is a BIG negative as it tends to favour hosts with high latency. More often than not I join players with 300 ping minimum, making teamwork at times impossible and being shot by laggy enemies)-frequent disconnections and slow wait times (as far as I can tell it seems it uses peer-to-peer matchmaking, reminiscent to the Call of Duty multiplayer on consoles. I found this especially bad in terrorist hunt, as we have 4/5 players in the lobby, I check my watch and on average I have to wait 2 minutes to find one more player! And it's ALWAYS one more player! Worse yet we can't start the match until we have a full roster, even then good luck because chances are you have 300 ping minimum. To rub more salt in the wound, when I leave the lobby I have to wait on average 15 seconds to reach the god damn main menu most of the time)-lazy tutorials (a bunch of short videos that show aspects of gameplay, but I had to dive into the options menu to figure out some of the damn key bindings. I figured the situations mode was a more in-depth tutorial mode, but 9/10 times I get absolutely destroyed with only a brief intoduction video to show me what the hell I am meant to be doing)-tedious UI (I have to actually be in the operator selection screen to be able to check my ping, before realising I'm bloody connected to a host in the northern hemisphere. Then guess what? I leave to find another host and I'm forced into more loading times----which just adds up, and up into blood boiling rage. At this rate a random dice roll would be better than this ♥♥♥♥♥ of a system)-odd bugs that cost you the outcome of a match (inconsistent kill cams really stood out to me, as one of my team mates shot the last enemy standing escorting the hostage, yet somehow we lost the game. Mind you we saw the kill cam where the enemy died and the hostage was perfectly fine. Another one I experienced was the whole teams audio dropped out, there was muzzle flash but we couldn't tell where the enemy was as sound plays a vital role in this game. My whole team died and in a cruel twist of fate, the sound recovered afterwards)Conclusion: I really did have fun with this game----WHEN I had a stable connection. As I said before, these issues seem to be mainly a regional problem. I feel like I'm spoilt for choice as with TF2 and CS:GO, in a click or two I'm already in a solid and stable game in little time, thanks to my server browser preferences. The game mechanics and scenarios are awesome, but in its current state I cannot recommend this. Ubisoft really needs to over-haul the matchmaking system, if it wants to maintain interest in the multiplayer market long term. I don't want to feel like I'm playing a multiplayer game on a console since finding a game is inconsitent and clunky, which makes it feel dated real fast. It makes me think that the system was in fact optimised for the consoles, which is a bad sign in itself.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 17, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '204100', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'First time I had several problems with random crashing and blue screen.

Finally, HSL removed the blacklight prime, a license that allowed only the ppl that had to pay $5 upfront before he/she could buy any ingame items using gp (ingame currency that u got from playing)Before that, the parity patch was pretty trashy-all we got as beta players were cosmetics (nice hat without stats) , a title and blacklight prime. Since newbies couldn't buy items to protect themselves from toxic ammo without paying in real cash, all the veterans (vets) had to do was join the team with most vets and they would almost certainly win if they used toxic ammo and explosives the new guys nvr could get their hands on. Toxic ammo does little direct dmg but can continue to down whittle ur health even after the bullets stop hitting u and also, it reduces ur max health so u couldn't heal back to full health even with the supply depot. Heal injectors could help to prevent one from dying but unfortunately, its a gp item.Plus, the level restriction prevented players from getting the guns or gear they wanted unless they've been playing for quite a while. After the christmas patch however There was no team balance either, not before and not now. Apparently there is a system to arrange for players to be in differing teams depending on their stats (to pit the vets against themselves and so on) but if the teams were even numbered, there is nothing to prevent the players from switching teams.Still no spawn protection as before. U could spawn into a mob of enemies or proximity mines (as usual).As for the mechanics: What  BLR promotes as gameplay is rather infuriating, camping and gangbanging. There is no mechanics to promote fighting as individuals. Going as a team is good, switching players to take frontline dmg helps as health regen will help to heal u back to half health and the moment u get a kill, u can recover to max health at a supply depot. However, there is no piercing ammo to counter this. Customisation is fixed before starting a round, if u wanted to change primaries, u would need a diffenrent customised slot for 10k gp as well as the weapon itself. The problem being, u couldn't change gear that way. If ur armor or is too slow or has too low hp for the playstyle that suits u, u would only have 30s to customise before the next round. There's no preset armor build to accompany the weapon sets. 1 armor set would be used for an entire match even if u change wep sets. Variety is lacking ever since the parity patch kicked in. No longer are the weapon tags (which boost stats by a little) free. No shock, no explosive nor magnum ammo. The only missions you get now are daily kills, daily wins and weekly dmg dealt (apart from headshot kills for the title). The only free skin for looking good is the daylight skin. U can no longer get the golden skin from the headshot kills achievement. U could no longer purchase the fox + cat helm and leveling only awards u with titles (at lvl 30 and above). If anything, I wished COD had the hrv (x-ray vision) and not this game. At least COD doesn't crash every few days, has ppl playing and has less absurd features like chat censorship.  Or frequent crashing. Still looking for the day where I'll change this review to a good one but if u were me, u'll get impatient too after a few yrs.""}]",-0.9633

This is curable late game)If a mission is at a dead end try opening the hack ability near doors etclook up some of the effective attack patterns! i found hacking REALLY HARDVision abilities are at the medical center in the HQ, once you have researched the right things to unlock them.This is great for sniping or scoping areas before you charge in.Ditto Cloak, if there is snipers etc this is pretty much a must have.The HQ is your home base, you can do enemy filled maps for small money by talking to the guy on the bridge or larger Secondary Missions by entering the big doors in the wall when they unlock. You will need to come here to level up a bit between Campaign missionsIf you fail a mission you still get paid and xp for all the murders you commited.Save your grinding until you get the noctis map :D'}]",-0.9608

H&G seemed a promising game, during the first few updates. However, the update that revamped the leveling system killed the game for me. This update completely reworked the amount point required for each rank and also poorly scaled the amount earned in battle. It seemed the game wanted me to be heavily reliant on its \'Pay2Win\' system which involved spending lots to gain little progress.Though I disapprove of its scheme to make money, I like how the idea for WWII fps has been conveyed through this game. I still recommend this game as it is still only early access and the many flaws it still has can be ironed out, as there is still time until Reto-Moto finally release it. To the digression of those willing to download, be wary of the game\'s performance, I run decent specs and it is still laggy as hell. Also keep track of server maintenance as it can get annoying.10/10 - IGN, ""Would flip a tank again.""'}]",-0.2732

Hackers run the game and nexon pretends that they care. If you did pay money for this game and want to buy end game equipment well guess what? nexon says that is illegal your only allowed to carry 10b at one time and end game equipments can be worth 100b+ making scams easier.

It gives off the impression that it\'s a basic match 3 game but NOPE it\'s not, it\'s got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don\'t bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man\'s repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can\'t say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame ♥♥♥ bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn\'t play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn\'t even badly damaged, if you don\'t heal your heroes they can\'t fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you\'d just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don\'t use the health pack, how do you get more health packs?

I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it\'s certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn\'t have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I\'ll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.The Good -The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I\'m talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you\'ll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn\'t mind seeing them in other games.-The Music: I\'ll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It\'s a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.The Okay-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can\'t sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can\'t. It\'s kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that\'s never a good thing.-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn\'t the best part of the game, you\'re not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.The Bad- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term ""bullet sponge"". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that\'s not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn\'t a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.All in all, RE:ORC is a game that\'s fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don\'t expect to be amazed by the game.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 24, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '248630', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Kingdoms Rise is without a doubt a game with a lot of potential but one that still needs a bit of work.The gameplay mechanics itself are pretty great, the idea of spells in the game are well done in some ways, and the map design is certainly interesting, encouraging players to learn the maps and think of certain strategies associated with those maps.

I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it\'s certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn\'t have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I\'ll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.The Good -The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I\'m talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you\'ll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn\'t mind seeing them in other games.-The Music: I\'ll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It\'s a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.The Okay-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can\'t sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can\'t. It\'s kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that\'s never a good thing.-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn\'t the best part of the game, you\'re not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.The Bad- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term ""bullet sponge"". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that\'s not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn\'t a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.All in all, RE:ORC is a game that\'s fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don\'t expect to be amazed by the game.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 24, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '248630', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Kingdoms Rise is without a doubt a game with a lot of potential but one that still needs a bit of work.The gameplay mechanics itself are pretty great, the idea of spells in the game are well done in some ways, and the map design is certainly interesting, encouraging players to learn the maps and think of certain strategies associated with those maps.

The default keybindings I found pretty terrible to be honest, and the game using Xbox controller key prompts made it all the more frustrating. After having played with a controller and changing the keys to my liking though, I have to say that I couldn't bring myself to go back to the controller.Dark Souls II has fairly decent graphics, but falls short of triple A releases. It makes up for that with a smooth 60 frames per second which is absolutely vital in a game like this which requires you to patiently learn enemies moves while dodging death by the breadth of a hair. Fortunately you don't need a beast of a PC to run it either, with my average (or below) set up of an AMD Radeon HD 6780 + four gigs of RAM I experienced maybe three or four frame drops through my ten characters.The game itself is really quite challenging. Casual gamers I'd imagine would have a hell of a time trying to adapt and I'd highly reccommend searching for the hidden attributes in some stats and what they fully affect, while Hardcore gamers will have plenty of room to trip up as well. Don't fret if the game feels too intimidating, failing is a large part of every Souls players first experience, it's the ecstacy in beating the jerk after your tenth try for some sweet revenge and coming back later in the game when you're more experienced to take the time to torture them.As far as Online Play goes... You'll find a lot of fantastic people willing to engage in jolly cooperation, but keep in mind that there are no rules in the Dark Souls universe, in a broken and decaying Kingdom it's every man for themselves and some people just want to watch the world burn.""}]",-0.9019

Então faltando um mês pro lançamento do capítulo 5 eu vi no youtube ( até em um canal que não conhecia, EletronicDesireGE ) achei a historia do jogo muito interessante e fiquei curioso para saber a conclusão. Decidi então comprá-lo e posso dizer que não me arrependo nem um pouco, nunca um jogo mexeu tanto comigo como LIS e olha que já joguei vários jogos incríveis com enredos fantásticos ( a saga Metal Gear por exemplo é um dos melhores jogos que já joguei em toda a minha vida ). Já me emocionei várias vezes jogando alguns jogos, mas nunca cheguei ao ponto de chorar ( eu diria que até muito no capítulo 5 ) como foi em Life Is Strange. Enfim, vamos aos finalmentes.História - 10 ( Já falei praticamente tudo anteriormente ; Não vou falar sobre o enredo mas é o ponto forte do jogo. De início parece ser aqueles dramas de adolescentes mas garanto que não e é muito mais profundo ).Gráficos - 9 ( ou 10, meu PC não é dos melhores então joguei tudo no médio ).Trilha sonora - 10 ( as músicas simplesmente se encaixaram perfeitamente em todos os momentos do jogo mesmo nem todas sendo originais ) .Gameplay - 10 ( apesar de bem simples responde bem aos comandos e não deixa a desejar, mas nem todos gostam desse estilo mais ""parado"", já eu não tive problemas nem com bugs graves e comprometedores apenas alguns objetos flutuando ).Personagens - 10 ( todos são muito carismáticos e memoráveis com personalidades bem diferentes e legais, as vozes também não deixam a desejar e tudo saiu perfeito ).Como disse anteriormente LIS mexeu muito comigo e recomendo a todos que gostam de uma ótima historia, pode ser ruim para os que não entendem em inglês ( não entendo 100 % támbem ) mas para isso tem a tradução nos sites DivinityPT e Casal Bits que fizeram um trabalho muito bom com poucos erros que não comprometem no entendimento do game.Gostaria de encerrar essa análise parabenizando o incrível trabalho ( da Square Enix também ) que a DONTNOD Entertainment fez com o jogo e espero que essa seja a primeira de várias obras de artes que eles possam fazer pois virei um fã do game e irei recomendar a todos, se tornou um dos melhores games que já joguei ( após o término do cap. 4 fiquei uns dias pensativo e quando terminei o jogo fiquei uns 5 dias com uma sensação esquisita, como se fosse tristeza ) e que me fez pensar muito sobre a vida, sobre tudo. Obrigado por essa incrível experiência e pela tristeza que vai permanecer por um tempo após ter concluído o jogo.Desculpe aos erros de português e por repetir varias palavras muitas vezes.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 30, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited January 2.', 'item_id': '200510', 'helpful': '1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'O que falar desse jogo que mal conheço e já considero pacas ?Apesar de não jogar muitos jogos de estratégia fiquei curioso com o X-COM e então decidi comprá-lo.

Ainda não testei a DLC enemy within mas já ouvi falar que muda algumas coisas pra melhor ). som - muito bom ( curti o som das armas, dos extraterrestres e das próprias músicas que por sinal algumas lembram Deus Ex : Human Revolution, que por sinal eu adoro ).Essa análise já está maior do que eu gostaria, mas pra ser mais breve ---->  Recomendo demais essa delícia de jogo, gostei muito e viciei.

Kills made by explosives will mostly torn your character into pieces, and usually the extremities will the ones getting off the bodies, arms legs, sometimes the head or half torso, etc. There\'s too much detail. The little isssue is when someone is getting shot there\'s gonna be a lot of blood splatting per hit, most games would make the blood be spilled and stay on the surfaces, this game doesn\'t do much of that, but it\'s that much of an issue.The combat skills such are TIER 1 and TIER 2 in most characters are fitting on science fiction and real science, such as optical cloak (this is an example) is not necessarily accurate due the movility would disturb this ability; you can ""download"" the TIER 1 version of the team mate if they use a TIER 2 skills, it\'s temporal and weaker but still near similar to the original character whom you downloaded the TIER skill, works as long as you\'re near host of the TIER skill and up to 3 other players that are not you.There\'s currently two female ressembling characters on this game.I could say more of this, but I think this is enough for now, this game is great for casual play or competitive play if it gets further such as having a competitive community, it has the potential for it.I give it 10/10 shooter game with science fiction and covert arts.'}]",-0.5518

Spawn in with the Negev (or equivalent machine gun), completely ignore all other weapons and I mean ALL, SMGs, Shotguns, other pistols, useless. Then proceed to midlessly hold left left click and sway the mouse from side to side. Solved. Either that or get completely overun by the insane amounts of idential zombies. Thats it. It is a very boring, repeditive game and thats all is all. I fell that maybe if this game has more modern elements (graphics, gore system, decent models etc) this game could be more fun but as is the game runs off a decade old system (CS:CZ) and it really shows.

I have bought all of their DLCs (Even the Completely Overkill Pack) so that i could support OVERKILL and help them bring new content to this game. But the new Weapon rebalance and Black market update have destroyed all faith i had in OVERKILL. If you have played CS: GO or have seen crate openings, it’s exactly the same thing. When you complete a heist, you may earn a safe that can only be opened by purchasing a drill. When you open the safe, you'll earn a random weapon skin with a random condition ranging from Broken-in (Battle Scarred) to Mint-Condition (Factory New). This would be alright, if it wasn't for one detail. Weapon skins can give you stat buffs. That’s right, a cosmetic actually improves the killing power of the weapon. It might improve accuracy, stability or total ammo, pretty much any stat. Who thought this was a good idea? This is a Pay to Win Mechanic. And the weapon rebalance has destroyed the weapons, either making a weapon extremely under powered or over powered. Revolvers do more damage than some sniper rifles, a DMR does more damage than a sniper, all shotguns except for double barrelled shotguns were nerfed to oblivion and most pistols are one shotting enemies on the highest difficulty. These changes have rendered the game completely unplayable and i will not be returning to Payday 2 until these issues have been fixed. (I should also mention a humorous bug that is currently in the game. The Minigun used to give a movement penalty and had mods that would reduce the movement penalty. They removed the Minigun movement penalty but not the mods ability to increase speed, meaning with both speed increasing mods for the Minigun, you run faster with it equipped than any other weapon)""}]",-0.9674

Power attack(sprint and attack) does virtually nothing better then a normal attack except more time consuming.the quest generally consist holding off zombies and clear the area or hunt down a certain zombie.my conclution, the mechanics of this game in general has out paced its stories, since it keeps adding timed events which will penalise the player for missing them on top of the quest story, supply gathering and the restriction around those so you cannot do more then 1 quest at a time, even if they consist the same sort of goal, multiple supplies cannot be loaded onto cars and must be carried by someone in order to take home.Edit 1: since it has been updated and i will go back into playing this for a bit and make changes to my review'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 30, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '108710', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'a well made game in general'}]",-0.3701

Lo que me encanta es que es un juego muy libre, no es necesario seguir un orden y nunca termina ya que es un gran mundo por explorar. Es un videojuego de rol de acción del tipo mundo abierto desarrollado por Bethesda Game Studios y publicado por Bethesda Softworks. Es la quinta entrega de videojuegos de acción y fantasía de la serie The Elder Scrolls y es posterior a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion y predecesor de The Elder Scrolls Online. Skyrim salió a la venta el 11 de noviembre de 2011 para las plataformas: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 y PlayStation 3. El 4 de junio de 2013 fueron lanzados al mercado tres complementos descargables: Dawnguard, Hearthfire y Dragonborn.La historia de Skyrim se centra en los esfuerzos del personaje del jugador para derrotar a Alduin, un dragón que, según la profecía, destruirá el mundo. La trama está fechada doscientos años después de los sucesos de Oblivion y tiene lugar en la provincia ficticia de Skyrim. En el transcurso de la partida, el jugador completa misiones y hace evolucionar a su personaje gracias al mejoramiento de sus habilidades. A diferencia de los juegos anteriores de Elder Scrolls, en Skyrim no se requiere que el usuario seleccione un tipo de personaje al inicio del juego, resolviendo así el problema que el equipo de desarrolladores veía desde de versiones anteriores: la necesidad de tener que forzar al usuario a un estilo rígido de juego. Skyrim continúa con la tradición de mundo abierto al permitir que el jugador viaje a cualquier parte del mapa del juego en cualquier momento y postponer indefinidamente u omitir parcial o totalmente la historia principal.Aunque no es una secuela directa de los anteriores juegos de Elder Scrolls, durante su construcción fue considerado como un sucesor de la filosofía de Oblivion y de Fallout 3 de 2008. El equipo de desarrolladores optó por un mundo de juego más diverso y único de lo que fue la comarca ficticia de Cyrodiil en Oblivion, los cuales fueron considerados menos interesantes por su director y productor ejecutivo Todd Howard, en comparación con Skyrim. Durante el estreno, recibió buenas críticas por sus cambios, sobre todo en lo tocante al sistema de desarrollo de los personajes, gracias a la experiencia ganada durante el desarrollo de las entregas anteriores de Elder Scrolls. No obstante, también recibió críticas negativas en cuanto a la pobreza del acabado en los detalles de los personajes y a los escuetos movimiento durante un combate cuerpo a cuerpo.

Saw some crabs walking around on the beach and decided to build a few traps. I caught a crab and was about to light a fire to cook it when I realized I'd depleted all my grass on making the traps and died alone and cold in the dark.Day 1 Attempt 2: I spawned a similarly small island this time, and was a bit more prepared. I gathered all the wood and grass on the island and went down to the beach. This time I set aside some grass for the fire, and dropped it on the ground and went about hunting crabs. While I was hunting it got real windy, and I noticed my grass blowing swiftly across the bay away from me. I gave chase but it reached the water before I could catch up. I died alone and cold in the dark again.Day 1 Attempt 3: I'm not screwing it up this time! I had a fire going by dark and enough food for a few days. This was gonna be easy...Day 5 Attempt 3: I've made further than I thought possible. I've set up a base in a beach biome, got all the tools and even have a small boat with a sail. This is awesome! I also rather cunningly used a pitchfork to take some swamp biome to my own base and grow swamp trees for an unlimited supply of wood! Eat that Bear Grylls...Day 9 Attempt 3: I feel so great at this point. I killed some spiders and built a net to catch some fireflies! Now I have a lantern on my boat! My swamp trees have fully grown has well and my wood harvesting has begun. On the second tree a yellow snake dropped out and bit me once. I died a slow toxic death.F**K THIS F**KING PIECE OF S**T10/10 Would die in every way except starving again.""}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 30, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited April 8, 2015.', 'item_id': '730', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Me and about 4 friends decided to buy CS:GO when it was on sale.

Epoch is quite good as you get fairly solid base building tools, vehicle modifications and random missions against bandits, mad scientists, heroes, and treasure hunters. Even with the best of PCs this game runs horribly. It's hard enough trying to survive in this game without your frame rate dropping to the point where you can't even aim to kill a zombie or player who is trying to kill you. Add to that the insane amount of cheaters and combat loggers and it is basically a death match, with random chances to die for no reason being extremely common (e.g. stand up in a house, die because the floor breaks your legs). Also, logging in and finding that a really nice piece of clothing or bullet proof vest you have has somehow become ruined (and thus damaging all of the gear in the clothing inventory slots) is common, and really frustrating. RIP plate carrier vest with gun pouch and Gorka military pants/jacket. May 2015 - May 2015, I crie evrytiem.I can't fathom why this game is priced so highly for early access, not when full release indie games (which can offer a much better experience) are usually lower in price. Elements that have been fixed for a long time in the mod (helicopter crashes, persistence, lack of loot) are suddenly broken in the standalone. Even new elements introduced into the standalone are broken later when something else is changed.This game might be more worthwhile when it is finished, but in its current state it is really not worth it.

There are currently 4 or 5 different types of missions which range from Exterminating enemies, to capturing wanted enemies & killing enemies to keep your oxygen levels up.WarFrames can all be obtained for FREE or by buying them for a CASH SHOP currency called Platnium. Most players find them as it isn't hard but it can be very very repetative (The whole game is very very very much so) At this time there are a range of 17 or 18 frames available to players & each one has abilities that are unique to that frame.Weapons & WarFrames can be upgraded by adding or removing mod cards that players get while doing missions (They are dropped by some of the enemies) This can give the weapon extra attributes that can make it do a few very helpful things like dealing certain types of damage. (Like Radiation damage or Viral damage etc)The level system in WarFrame is a bit different from the sort most people will have encountered in most other games in that a player gains Mastery Points only by actually using weapons & frames so they level up. Everything has a level cap of level 30 as far as Frames & weapons go & ATM the highest level available to players Mastery is level 15 or 16 (Cant remember atm sorry)WarFrame was a let down for myself as I have been playing for some time during it's development & it seems to have stalled hard. It has been turned into a grind fest with players having to basically do the same type of missions all the time from the vey lowest levels to the very highest. I wouldn't recommend the game to people I know in real life as it currently stands, & hopefully the developers will find the right track & make the game good again""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 11, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '301520', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Nice game where you build your own robot from the ground up!Is even better now they have done a lot more work to how matching is done & the restrictions have brought things a long way.Easy as hell to play & ""ALWAYS FUN"" for ALL AGES!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 18, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '317360', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""D.A.B is another one of those FPS style shooters where there really is no point to playing other than killing each other. Although the game is easy to master it very quickly becomes boring to play as other than 2 or 3 minutes of server directed mission the only other thing to do is kill each other while basically doing a very very limited number of stunts for points.Your character is controlled by the usual Keys (W,A,S,D) & the mouse & the key binbdings can be customised.Most of the maps are not real big & most of the weapons are able to shot from one side all the way to the other. ATM there are at least 1 of the weapons in the game that are OverPowered but you are able to choose from 2 types of pistols & 3 or 4 types of rifles from M16 through to a Shotgun.There is no real way of boosting health back up once you have lost it other than dying & respawning at full health again. When killed there is basically NO drawback as everything in the game is FREE & available to ALL players ALL the time.D.A.B is not a game I would recommend to anyone that asked me though at the moment as the game is currently struggling to keep the few players it still has. (There are at least 100 characters playing the game by the Leader Board around the world) At some times of the day you will struggle to find a server with more than 6-8 players on it & just about every day you will struggle to find more than 40 or 50 in total online at any one time.The graphics for the game are not bad but they suffer from a few bugs still in some places. I would guess that just about any computer could handle this game at it's lowest settings but am not sure what the minimum system reqs are.D.A.B has inbuilt Voice communications ability & all a player really needs is their headset & they are able to talk to other players in the same game as they are. Having to put up with some of the younger people that use the Voice comms can be very frustrating though as they tend to make stupid noises & stupid voices over it. (ATM I am not sure if you are able to MUTE individual players which is maybe something they will do in the future)In summing up I really can't recommend that ANYONE take the time to download this game as it is very much dying ATM due to a FAST growing number of HACKERS that basically wreck the game for 15 minutes for everyone else by 1 shoting other players which doesn't give you a chance as most of the weapons in the game take several shots to kill another player with so you always loose to trying to face off with them.Maybe if the developers do something about the lack of in the game then the game would be a whole lot better, but with the hackers, the lack of much to do ingame & the repetitiveness I think they might have a HUGE task infront of them that they just may not be able to complete.So try it if you must but don't say I didn't warn you!""}]",-0.998

At every turn, you will be reminded of the desolation of the nuclear catastrophe that ended the world as we know it. The ghosts of the dead, the ruins of Moscow and once-great landmarks like the Kremlin, and the dirty, shambolic metro townships all elicit some measure of the despair and sadness that plagues what is left of humanity as they attempt to survive the grave new world their destruction has left behind. The top-notch graphics and sound-work make the world extremely immersive and realistic.   The gameplay fits well with the atmosphere the game provides, with scarce ammunition, the bullet currency system, deadly enemies and regular stealth sections all coming together to give the impression of bare-knuckled survival. The enemy AI is a bit lacklustre at times, but this is only noticeable in a few cases. It generally makes you feel very vulnerable and threatened at all times.

It started out as this ambitious little title that spawned from a simple mod in Roblox of all things, to now being a widely played, charming game that gained numerous fans and a good community. It has been great to follow along with the creator of the game and watch it evolve into a poor mans dayz, while maintaining a very good aspect of fun and survival. But much to my and many other peoples dismay, some recent updates to the game have been a little troubling. What I am mainly talking about is the inclusion of new zombie types, which is very reminiscent of special infected from left 4 dead. Now this is not a bad thing, a bit of challenge and variety in the ways of enemies is great and very entertaining, but that is where the good parts of the update end. In my experience, being a bambi on a new or even long played server is tough, as the persistent threat of bandits and zombies is a constant looming hazard, and without gear or teammates to aid you, you are likely to die very quickly. Thankfully, the zombies were easy to fight off and bandits were semi-easy to avoid, but with the inclusion of these dangerous new zombie types it has made things for bambi's in particular, and even game-smart and geared players, so much harder. The Mega zombie which is usually a zombie people avoid like the plague due to his incredible stength and close to one shot kills, is now able to almost kill you instantly FROM A DISTANCE with a hunk of thrown concrete, because apparently the mega zombie wasnt powerful enough. Then there is the fire zombie, which when killed explodes in fire, making melee combat near impossible, spreads to other zombies which in turn makes them fire zombies also, which means if there is a fire zombie in a horde and you kill it, there will be a giant horde of fore zombies coming towards you. Next is the spitter zombie, which shoots acid at you from a long distance and can kill you very quickly if you are in a gear menu and unawares to his presence. Lastly is the zombies that can turn INVISIBLE and can kill you extremely quickly because you can't see them at all even with the faint purple outline that doesnt help at all. Also there is the fast, quadriped zombie but that can be killed quickly so it isn't as bad. In conclusion, Unturned is an excellent game that I want to keep growing and getting better, but it is currently being hindered by new zombie types that make the game so unnecassarily harder, especially for fresh spawns. Maybe if some of these zombies were removed (which I know is hard process) or maybe nerfed to a reasonable level, it would make the game just a little less difficult. Tl;Dr The new zombies make the game too difficult and need a nerf or removal""}]",-0.9948

Whoever thought of this is genius. The game mechanics of Portal are changed, but nonetheless still have the same feel to it and, although confusing at first, you get used to them.The only things that really sucks about this game are three things.1. There's this part where you have to deactivate some machines and stuff, you have to go on an insane track of jumping and speeding and everything, except my instincts told me to go to this little square in the wall, but when it said to skip the section ahead, I didn't read it properly and jumped it to it, and the worst part is that it doesnt even skip it, it plays someone playing it which was REALLY lame. I was really disappointed and I didn't want to play through the whole chapter again for that one bit.2. Like Portal, almost no replay value.3. The ending of the game is just really bad. This new personality core called Nigel (who is likeable and funny) has been hinted as evil and wants to kill you towards the end of the game. But the ending is just a copy and paste of the original Portal. You're on a platform, descending into fire and, because your paint gun was deactivated, there was no way to avoid it. The game even points out the loophole of you not needing to die, and the last thing you hear is just Nigel describing the rising temperature and then the credits roll. This left a really bad taste in my mouth and it just felt the same but worse, because at least in Portal there's a lot more even after you think the inevitable. That really sucked and I didn't like the ending really. And there's not even really any end in sight of the game, it just sort of ends.But overall, this game is worth the money. It's got a community workshop, which is pretty cool granting lots of possibilites. If you're a fan of Portal 2 you'll like this game.Pros:-Great mechanics-Great gameplay-Good voice actingCons:-Ending isn't up to par with the rest of the game-No replay value really-No real easter eggs of sorts8/10""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 22, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited July 21, 2014.', 'item_id': '4000', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'I love Garry\'s Mod first up. I\'ve had some of the best times playing with friends on Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist Town and murder and things like that. There are infinite add ons and so much fun to be had.But the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimes.If you have no friends online and you don\'t feel like sandbox, you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play TTT, murder, Prop Hunt, etc... But the people on these servers are just awful most of the time. What I\'ve noticed is that there\'s a very limited selection of the types of people in Garry\'s Mod. Either it\'s the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things, or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives. I\'m not saying all people are like this, but it\'s just how it usually is. RDMer\'s in TTT are the worst who kill for no reason, and another thing in TTT is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things. I cannot recommend the multiplayer servers.Another cheap sort of way to get money is to buy Counter-Strike: Source along with it. That\'s another $15 on the $10 price tag, and you (like me) may think ""I don\'t want to buy it"" and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle. See, the thing is, that in Garry\'s Mod, if you don\'t have the certain texture or addon for an item or map, there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you can\'t see the items. And some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with Counter-Strike: Source. And if you don\'t, you have to go online and find ALL THE TEXTURES and ALL THE MAPS in a bundle, open up your Steam folder and dragging them in. These packs take about half an hour to download, and you need to download all the gamemodes, excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly.  I mean, come on, at least give us a warning guys. To me this seems like a ripoff if you didn\'t know and a cheap way of getting money.Overall, I really love Garry\'s Mod, but I love it the most when I\'m playing with friends on a private match or by myself in Sandbox. If you\'re gonna buy it for online multiplayer, I do not recommend it. If you\'re going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer, I fully recommend it.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Great gamemodes-A lot to do and downloadCons:-Bad community-Textures and addons (sometimes)I will keep Garry\'s Mod at a 7/10(i know this is a very negative review, but I just wanted to let you know the bad about Gmod before you buy it)'}]",-0.9981

It incorporates elements of minecraft, with the crafting, building and general look of the game, whilst also including core elements from day z - with survival elements of food, water, sickness, blood becoming important. You\'ll spend a lot of time raiding towns for crucial gear and a lot of time fighting zombies who literally cannot be ""de-aggro\'d"" (the old ""walk through some trees and lose the zombies"" doesn\'t apply here). The fun increases exponentially when you play with a friend, you can create a base using the massive and (mostly) easy to follow crafting menu/crafting wiki. Setting up a base is a very satisfying experience but it should be noted that players and zombies can destroy and player built structure. The game runs smoothly at the lowest settings on my potato of a rig, but I’ve noticed that any attempt to increase the graphics leads to excessive fps drop. The lowest settings are still significantly better than minecraft graphics, though, so fear not. Currently there is not a server browser for unturned, this makes playing online somewhat of a tedious adventure.. Currently your best bet of finding a server is trolling through the steam servers and hoping to find an IP address/server that isn\'t full and is actually hosting at the time. I\'ve personally had more success with hamachi servers than the standard IP ones, but even then it\'s very hit and miss. IF you can find a good PVP server it is great fun and I’d highly recommend trying it out. The survival elements on a PVP match can be too unforgiving though, and frequently you die of starvation/thirst (of course player related deaths are common, too). But there\'s nothing quite like hunting down the player who killed you last and killing them with three awfully aimed body shots from your scavenged mosin nogant (praise the Russians for their weapon prowess) and then stealing their poncho and tea-bagging the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ out of their raided, bullet ridden corpse (rip never 4get). Whilst on the topic of player v player combat, BULLETS HURT and you bleed quite significantly after being shot. This is a great bit of realism that makes pvp skirmishes that much more strategic. I\'ll probably never forget having to use my trousers as a bandage to stop the bleeding from a bullet wound incurred from a friend who was ""trying to test the range of the rifles"", what a fething scrubl0rd. I have some gripes about the crafting system, namely how difficult it is to find a canteen or to craft one. I fail to see why we can\'t use an empty tin can/water bottle to collect water, in fact I fail to see why we can\'t just drink from the water using the players block like hands (dafuq?). Also it is quite difficult to craft new magazines using empty magazines and combining them with boxes of ammunition. This is mostly due to the fact that empty magazines take up one free inventory slot EACH and cannot be stacked like regular magazines/shells. This makes finding/creating a dependable supply of magazines quite frustrating. I do however like the fact that empty magazines drop to the ground (unless it\'s your last one) when you reload, this system makes it much more realistic. But it\'s still an early access game so these things maybe changed in the future.DESPITE THIS, the game is epic. It is free. It is fun to play. It\'s hilarious with friends AND for a measly 50mb download you literally have no reason not to give it a try. TLDR; Great game get on it scrubl0rds. '}]",-0.9686

While most game developers would aim to build on existing positives, X Rebirth\'s devs have taken everything GOOD about the original games, and thrown them completely out of the window in order to squeeze in some ""pretty new graphics"", which in all honesty, aren\'t that impressive to begin with and seem more of a throwback to mid 2000\'s graphics engines. The removal of third person views, multiple ship control, gate travel (a new ""taxi tube"" system has been developed to shuttle your ship from system to system, which is absolutely TERRIBLE) and many ""new features"" are actually fancy detractions from what made the original X series so great. The addition of being able to walk around in stations sounded great at first, but is extremely limited in it\'s function and serves no great logical purpose to the game that couldn\'t be solved easier with menus and communications channels, except to make the game boringly and frustratingly mundane each time you are forced to wander around stations upon docking. Trade is just about non-functional, often causing game-breaking errors and lockups, and combat although beautiful to watch is just as broken. I am sorry to say that I was duped into pre-ordering this game with the promise of great things...

As a trio of civilians living in shell of a house, you start from scratch and essentially progress through the game by gradually improving your hideout, as you simultaneously stave off disease, depression, looters and hunger.  Balancing all of these competing threats is significantly easier said than done.The game really evokes the grim reality of a modern war, in both its art style and gameplay.  Losing one of your civilians is actually quite emotionally profound; each civilian ha their own backstory and specific skill, but also hopes and dreams, as well as interesting quirk (e.g. smokes, or enjoys reading).  Keeping them alive is tough, but in my first playthrough it was not disease or depression that killed my poor family, but blundering into armed thugs and being shot for their troubles.  As inglorious and abrupt as these ends were, it didn't break the immersion whatsoever; people die in stupid ways in war.  What's more, the civilian deaths deeply affect your fellow characters, severely depressing them.  Let this go unattended for too long, and they may commit suicide.  Brutal.As wonderfully depressing and harsh as this game is (and long; a dev. commentary stated that the war could progress for as long as mere weeks to months!), I did feel that the weapon, and shooting, mechanics could be explained a little better.  I don't really know when the best situations are to use firearms, how to acquire all the necessary parts or even how to use them.  BUT, this is a minor complaint, and reflective of the fact i chose to ignore firearms completely in favour of scavenging as much as I could peacefully, then getting the hell outa there.All in all, a really emotionally profound game thats incredibly depressing, and tough to play for extended periods of time.

After punching a wolf to death with a flashlight I went on to locate a mountain. At the top I found 4 guys chasing a deer with axes and fists, after helping them in the deer chase (we yelled ""YOU CAME TO THE WRONG NEIGHBOURHOOD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" the entire time as we chased it) and eventually axing the poor doe to bits for some venison and a deer bladder we cheered like sandpeople from star wars for a brief moment. I continued back around the mountain through what seemed like endless woods until I heard a loud noise coming from the sky. The dreaded Air Drop was on it\'s way. Whatever luck there was with me at the time seems to have worked as the Air Drop was deployed dead above my head (no ♥♥♥♥, I didnt even call it in), a minute later the drop landed in the middle of water shattering into a small crate and some 10 zombies stacked atop one another. Being almost unarmed I dropped my balls and ran for my life only to realize that zombies were not interested in me, they were content with performing acrobatic acts with one another that would quialify them for olympics. By then 3 other people ran towards the crate and got the attention of the cirque du soleil troupe. As they tried to disperse them around to gain access to the crate with lewt I did the impossible. Using my rambo bush crawling tactics i snuck up to the crate and began to open it. It took 10 seconds to open it but once it did i was graced with an AR15, a belt pouch, a tan backpack and a syringe. Hallelujah I thought to myself, I finally have a gun and am no longer simply fresh meat for whatever is hungry. But what about the 3 poor souls that used an Air Drop ticket to get absolutely nothing AND have had one of their own die while i hoarded their belongings (legal theft is awesome isn\'t it). I realized that without the gun or any extra space they are sure to be doomed. As the female in the group approached me yelling ""GIVE ME BACK MY DEAD BOYFRIEND\'S STUFF"" I realized how much of a lowly human being I was when i resorted to the cheapest tactic known to man to gain benefit for myself at the expense of another person\'s life. I had to do the right thing... I turned around and sincerely apologized to the surviving 2 members of the group with 2 carefully placed .223 shots, and 8-11 rapidly repeated crouch animations above each of the dying players\' heads . And then I couldn\'t hear anything, serenity has settled in and peace was a possibility once again.Day 2:Since my life began in H1Z1 world I have learned something VERY important, placing landmines outside someone\'s shack tends to ""irritate"" players. I mean it isn\'t my fault they didnt try to disarm the landmine they could have never expected to be outside their safe haven. Yet I still get people messaging me through steam calling me scum of earth and all that, even though I just taught them a very important lesson, ungrateful louts.Day 3: Cooked 3 doses of crack...'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted April 2, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '355840', 'helpful': '2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'First of all disregard time played, I have been playing this game from the moment it entered the Closed Beta.Game ModesWell where to begin. At this point in time Survarium has several PvP modes available for you to play.First up is Scavenge, in this mode 2 teams of 8 players start must sniff around the map for batteries,these spawn in random but fairly predictable locations around the map, some will be out in plain sight,and some close to or within the anomaly( I will get to this later) on the map. These must be picked upand delivered to a charging station located close to your spawn and indicated on the map, while carryingyou are 100% vulnerable, unable to spring or perform any functions aside from moving, jumping and beingable to drop the battery. There are a total of 10 of them all around the map and you need to have moreon your team\'s side to win. Mind you while this sounds simple it is much more complicated than that,as batteries can be STOLEN by the enemy and vice versa, a common and rather sour strategy is to collecta ""safe"" amount of batteries, usually 6 or +2 of whatever the enemy has, and when the countdown reacheslow like 10 - 20 seconds depending on the map, people just rush the enemy charger and unplug all batteries.Next mode is Charging Stations, in this mode instead of locating the batteries several charging stations areplaced within the environment, these randomly but once again fairly predictably spawn a single battery whichmust be taken to your charging station, once the first battery is spawned they begin spawning subsequently roughlyonce every 30 seconds.Third and the most recently added mode is Research, I personally do not like this mode and avoid it, so go findinfo on it somewhere else.Last but not least is your traditional Team Deathmatch, no batteries, just pure old fashioned bloodshed with 150spawn tickets for each team and 15 minutes of time, whichever runs out first.FeaturesSurvarium can be played in several different ways, much like the majority of modern day shooters you have accessto a rather impressive arsenal of weapons and gear, and decent customization to both. At this stage the guns cannotbe messed with, ie silencers scopes etc, but that will be added at some point in time. The outfitting customizationhowever is most impressive, different types of clothing Feet/Legs/Chest/Hands/Face/Head/Back, of these Chest and Headcan have changeable cloth types and camo types as well up to 2 player placed decals. You can basically blend into almostanything in the game if you know how to do it right, and if not moving you can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to see, and locate.While most people think ""Ohhh f**king campers everywhere"" allow me to assure you that it is not the case as the guns beingso goddam lethal if you know where to shoot a sniper is rarely stationary, moving place to place as the sound alone willattract every enemy within half the map\'s radius. That pretty much covers the basic stuff. And then there are things likeTraps, Explosives, Anomalies and Artifacts, oh and soon Mutants. At this point in time the only trap is the Bear Trapwhich, if stepped on, will 9/10 times break your legs and cripple you, as well as take a third of your hp, oh and make youbleed too, if carefully placed, 2 or 3 traps can be triggered at the same time for an amplified effect, 2 traps will putyou into critical condition and make you vulnerable to one hits from most guns, 3 traps will kill you instantly, at lowerlevels in the game that ammount is less with 2 traps being a killer and a single one being a crippler. Combine these withSmoke Grenades (damn the effect in this game is really GOOD) and you have yourself one helluva an advantage knowing wherethe traps are. Grenades at this point is the only explosive, BUT, holy ♥♥♥♥ is it good, you can run and hide from thembut if cooked to perfection only an activated Onyx artifact has a small chance of saving you, you will still be bleedingfrom every single body part there is and will need medical attention. The Anomalies in this game are present on mostbut not every map, Cologne Bridge for example does not have Anomalies and therefore does not have Artifacts. Anomaliesare either Gaseous, Radioactive, Toxic and Electric in nature, each one will affect you differently and at different speedsdepending on your outfitting, with some requiring only a small amount of protection to enter, you will use antitoxins90% of the time when you are interracting with one, these help you live through the anomaly without dying in seconds.Once inside one you will gradually take anomaly damage, this is indicated by the visual change on the screen, everythingwill begin to shift in colors and focus ranges as well as tube like vision effects, basically like some good ACID. Oncethis reaches a certain point you will die in a blink of an eye regardless of HP. So WHY would one seek entry in such atreacherous place? 2 reasons, one being the fact that anomalies are cleverly placed, they are usually blocking off thefastest/safest path to the enemy base or otherwise cut off access to certain locations, and then there are Artifacts.These little bad boys are a real gamechanger, there is a total of 6 different types of artifacts with different passiveand active effects to complement a variety of playstyles. From damage reducting Onyx or movement enhancing Spring tomy personal favourite the Sponge, which soaks up anomaly damage passive, and can be thrown in a form of a toxic gasgrenade. Best part of it, the passive AND active effects can all stack, both with one another and with themselves.Aside from that there your obvious med kits and bandages and items called ""Rations"", these occupy one equipment slotand are consumed at the start of the round, giving the user a solid boost to a certain factor of the game, dependingon what you ate. They are however rather costly, especially for newbies, so I suggest you stay away until you have amil silver floating around unused.SettingSurvarium is set in a world where mother nature has had enough of your ♥♥♥♥, and decided to give us humans the boot upthe ♥♥♥ and kicked us out of cities and homes while casually murdering the majority of human population. Once she\'d hadenough people began to emerge and blah blah blah blah and you know, now we wanna kill each other because there is nothing todo and the world is a complete sausage-fest. The environment around you is overgrown and ravaged by nature, grass is up toyour nuts, some trees reach to the skies, and buildings are now just a gloom, pale and lifeless memory of what once wasour home, and when no guns are firing the sound of clarity fills the air. From distant birds to the sound of wind crossingthe halls of a School. In short, the atmosphere is nothing short of breathtaking, the sounds just bleeds into the atmospheremaking you feel like you are really there. All that, generously painted with Vostok\'s very own engine, designed specificallyfor this purpose.These are the biggest points of the game, everything mentioned above is the ""Good"". Now we move onto the ""Bad"".Like many other online shooters the game suffers from ping. At this point in time there are no Oceanic servers, whichmakes it painful to enjoy the game, but with proper configs I was able to achieve playable ping and could kick ♥♥♥ atleast half the time. The game is VERY ping dependent, so if you are not close to the currently available servers I suggestto not play until there domestic servers near you, as high ping will CERTAINLY ruin your experience.Then there is a very big question of Pay To Win. Some would say that the game is completely free, other people will saythat it\'s P2W. I think it is neither. On one hand you have the choice to play for free, you will have access to everythingthere is in game, except for purchaseable camos/decals'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 16, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218230', 'helpful': '1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""A must have game for anyone who likes large scale 3-way warfare.

Rarely will you ever come across repetitive tedious hard labour as hideous as this. The occassional bug that lets you fall thru the floor or get trapped in a wall comes as a refreshing break in the horrid mix of broken gameplay and cut-scenes which take away any weapon upgrades you have fought hard to achieve, either by switching you back to the single hand gun or simply removing all other weapons from your inventory, leaving you wondering why you worked so hard to get other weapons and ammo supplies, or even why they were dangled there to temp you in the first place.The most horrid aspect of fighting in MP3 would have to be this ""last man standing"" feature which takes away all control in a gun fight and forces you to target on a single enemy who has dealt you a mighty blow, and somehow you are supposed to enjoy suddenly ripping your attention away from the fierce battle that had your full attention, and shoot just one enemy in slow motion, if you can, before dying.  Personally I would prefer if the game let me just do my own thing in a battle, and if I am hit with a killing shot then so be it.  Let me use my meds and battle sense to do it my way.  Last-man-standing is probably the most hateful feature I have ever encountered in a game.  Have I missed a feature that lets me turn that off?The greatest wonder I am left with is WHY I have spent so much time trying to complete this game and why I have not simply deleted all traces of it from my pooter.'}]",-0.9942

One day, It was'nt just any day... It was the day the tourists flew over our wonderful island dropping ♥♥♥♥ on top of houses...

He was scared so he ran, John knocked again Silence he called along his trusty pal with an out dated 2k11 C4 and planted it on the decaying door *BANG* Allahu heard the crowd storm into his house creating havoc and looting, Allahu cried clenching his c4 whilst he was wishing he was home, The crowd were done with the loot and house and were looking for him He shreeked as they began dismantling the Iron door Allahu forgot his assault rifle on his table, He was defense was weak they were in allahu chucked the c4 far into the crowd and ran... He ran as fast as he could until he got to the edge of the island and sat down in pain... All his hard work was gone... T'was a tough night for Allahu he couldnt believe what was happening...

Another gripe is that there is no way to buy or trade items with other players, due to the card drop system (one random card after each completed mission) it can be exceptionally hard to get some weapon accessories. After 103 hours of playing there are still some basic weapon accessories that i want and have been unable to get.I'll give it 7/10. Worth getting if it's on sale.""}]",-0.9663

A last man standing multiplayer deathmatch game with survival elements (basic crafting, looting, basic resource gathering). It's a Battle Royale-esque game (though more like The Condemned IMO), that takes place inside a dome with 16 contestants and up to 25 minute rounds.The game itself has a good concept but overall it feels quite cheap.The melee combat system uses a rock, paper, scissors mechanism consisting of attack, block & shove. The balancing with the system is fine IMO, no complaints here. (Shoving briefly staggers the opponent or 'defeats' their block for those wondering.)The system is quite clunky in its current state though. Seeing as melee combat is essentially the main aspect of the game, it is quite disappointing. The feedback when you land a blow or get struck isn't great either. Rust has better melee feedback (& that isn't saying much).Add bad netcode and high latency servers on top of that and it just feels very sloppy. (AWS cloud servers btw.. Horrible for real-time/twitch games. I hope they eventually move to proper dedicated servers!)I understand it's in Early Access, but compared to the other Early Access games I've played, this is lacking. I really wanted to like this game but the basic elements that make up the core gameplay have been ...I wouldn't say poorly but rather, crudely executed.Honestly, I would probably come back to this game sometime in the future once more time has been spent developing the core mechanics. I see a promising future ahead for this game as long as they iron out the kinks and continue working on and improving the current foundations of the game, but I don't see that happening for at least another 6+ months so that's why I cannot recommend the game at this point in time.""}]",-0.9382

A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc)and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big ♥♥♥ weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind!The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top!The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them!

It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers. Combat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That\'s it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you\'re fighting near a weapon drop you can\'t change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there\' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as ""strategy"". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you. The item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you\'re just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it\'s entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.Oh, and there\'s no save system. At all.All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that ""might"" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are. If you\'re at all thinking of picking up this title anyway, I highly recommend buying another game called One-Way Heroics instead, which in a nutshell is practically like this game with the improvements I just suggested, and at only somewhat more than half the price.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 22, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '25980', 'helpful': '17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'I really wanted to like this game, what with being a huge fan of the origianl, but I found myself screaming at the stupidity of the A.I. way too much to find this game entertaining past the first few levels. And since the only way to have any sort of control over the units is to plant reward signs over objectives, having competent A.I. is important, and yet Paradox managed to make the the ""heroes"" even dumber, greedier and shortsighted than in the original. Yes, I said greedier: Finding yourself wasting thousands of gold on glass cannon wizards because they repeatedly get tunnel vision and attempt to run past hordes of enemies for a pitiful bounty, only to act surprised when they\'re brutally mobbed, is nothing short of infuriating. Other times, heroes will ignore their homes being burnt to the ground because they\'re too busy buying new armor (and yes, in the original, they WERE capable of noticing when their home buildings were being attacked) or attempt to take on targets WAY above their league.Trial and error is a huge part of this game, which shouldn\'t be the case. Take the forth mission: I wouldn\'t have a problem with a massive dragon coming almost instantly to wreck havok to set the stage, but half the time it starts by immediately burning the buildings I just built to the ground, wasting huge amounts of my precious resources. And this was AFTER the narrator told me ""be careful not to alert the dragon, or he\'ll attack you before you\'re prepared""... which turns out is complete misinformation because the brute comes after you immediately no matter what.Get the original.

Hit detection is unreliable, your range is rubbish and the sound for smacking an enemy in the face is almost exactly the same as your projectile puttering out fight in front of them: I found myself firing at a boss thinking ""boy, this guy is really soaking up the hits"" only to realize that half of my shots are either landing harmlessly in front of him or striking/passing through a section that apparently doesn\'t take damage (And no, we\'re not talking about bosses who can only be hurt in one vulnerable section). And don\'t get me started on the fast, unpredictable bosses who are hard enough to hit WITHOUT the crazy amounts of shots they fire out.Enemy/room balancing leaves a lot to be desired. The game uses a ""lighting"" mechanic which makes it hard to see very far: a nice gimmick, but incredibly annoying when faced with enemies with extremely fast projectiles that come with no warning in huge rooms, or traps that spring when you come vaguely close. The props dealt about rooms lends some aethetic charm, but at times are difficult to predict whether they\'ll block movement or projectles. My main bugbear are certain enemies that fire slow moving clouds in your general direction. Doesn\'t sound too bad? Wait until there\'s four of them in a tight room, and they\'re all huddled away in hidey holes that can only be shot at from one direction (which you can\'t reach because the clouds chase you away while your aforementioned rubbish range can\'t hit them), AND there\'s an extra enemy who\'s raining down chairs so you can\'t even stand in the sweet spots for two seconds.I like hard games. I don\'t like games that get their difficulty from tedious play and horrible controls. I want to fail for reasons that are my fault, not because I didn\'t want to spend two minutes in ONE room taking potshot at those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ entrenched smog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, or because I couldn\'t tell all my shots were missing because there\'s no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ audio/visual difference between hitting and missing something, or because the game wants to be a bullet hell without polished, reliable mechanics.And to think some people accuse this game of being a Binding of Isaac ripoff.

The team that manages the engine and physics are quite good, though not the best. Aircraft and vehicle modelleling is the greatest I\'ve seen for a game with such a variety of vehicles. Gameplay is amazingly smooth and simple.I cannot recommend it due to many controversial decisions made by the developers. Ignoring the playerbase in terms of balancing the matchmaking. Gaijin have created a problem that only becomes worse. When there are many players playing a large range of vehicles, (generally) effective matchmaking would clump a few evenly matched vehicles together for an intense fight.However if a vehicle was introduced/""balanced"" to be too effective/ineffective, naturally people would flock/avoid that vehicle. This creates increased queue times due to the inbalance of demand of vehicles. People complain and Gaijin allows a wider variety int he one game, this can (and did) lead to further imbalance. Thus, more people avoid it/leave. This makes the balancing act harder and both Gaijin and the playerbase stressed.Of course, this depends on your reason on playing War Thunder and the matchmaking may not be a concern, also Gaijin isn\'t doing too badly at the moment, it\'s just greatly inconsistent matchmaking leading to either utter defeat or victory simply due to vehicle selection and not player skill.Any aircraft could easily kill a much higher tiered aircraft if they\'re not using their speed advantage or experience. I have killed MiG-15\'s in an F6F Hellcat. However in ground forces, it is practically impossible to kill a much higher tiered tank due to their armor and firepower keeping you at a massive disadvantage.Game Modes:Arcade Battles:Best place to learn the ropes, manoeuvres target leading, positioning, awareness and map knowledge. Physics have been tweaked for faster gameplay and easier to handle aircraft. This mode is where I spent about half of my time on, learning how to fly different types of aircraft and their weapons. Ground forces arcade is very intense and can be very much run, gun, die repeat. Dodging cannons rounds and ramming enemies off cliffs.Realistic Battles:Common for more skilled players like myself. Vehicles perform closely to historical documents (which aren\'t the most accurate due to multiple sources). Requires extensive knowledge of own vehicle, enemies and map to effectively defeat the enemy. In this game mode, teamwork and communication is also introduced. (Yes, teamwork and communication is almost non-existent in arcade) NOTE: Although teamwork is indeed key, people are people and will sometimes be selfish or ignorant which can lead to many losses. You basically have to hope that your team isn\'t braindead to charge the enemy into a disadvantaged position.Simulator Battles:What is this? DEAD :(In aircraft used to force cockpit views and requires a joystick (although with practice you can go without). It tries to have the primary components of real combat without having to worry about issues real pilots have. Can be very intense however it has an extreme learning curve and almost certainly requires a wingman. Like RB, however these skills are truly put it to the test.The game indeed has its great moments, when the odds are stacked even greater against you than the developers intended and you still break through. However too often you\'ll just die hopeless, with the only way of avoiding it is to drag out the match.'}]",-0.9931

Playing 5 characters, and a total of approximately 600 hours on playstation (with many unfortunate characters RIP of corrupt data). I have played very close to every mission in the base game. However due to Bethesda being Bethesda, and for some reason having something against playstation users, I was forced to apeal to Gaben and open my wallet to his relentless steam sales. In doing so I was able to get the game of the year edition for Skyrim for less than it would have cost to buy one of the DLCs for PS3.But you dont care about any of this, do you.Skyrim is a spectacular game. It is rich with lore, history, and an amazingly open and free world. Skyrim redefined what it is to be an RPG, and set a standard that no game has truly been able to match since. I have no faults to talk about in Skyrim, no bugs, no unfair or unbalanced parts of the game to mention. And now, with the Ultra DLC you can download for free, the game could not look any prettier.

Só por isso o game já merece ser comprado. A jogabilidade permanece como a do Bioshock original, só com algumas melhorias. Tem umas armas e Plasmídeos diferentes, o que deixa o jogo bem interessante.A história do jogo é espetacular, o vilão principal e os ajudantes do protagonista também são muito bem feitos. Esse jogo te envolve em Rapture, e cada vez que alguma coisa importante acontece, você sente na pele. Isso faz a ambientação dele muito boa.Recomendo assim como recomendei no meu review do jogo original a exploração total, ainda mais porque nesse game ela compensa MUITO mais. O elemento de survival horror é usado DEMAIS. Se prepare pra cagaços e jumpscares, e uma dica: sempre tome cuidado quando for pegar algum Gene Tonic em uma sala vazia. É sério.As escolhas do jogo são como as do Bioshock original, matar ou não matar. Mas não é só sobre as Little Sisters, você pode escolher matar alguns outros personagens e isso influencia tanto no decorrer do jogo como no final (no total há 6 finais possíveis) e lembrando que apenas o final ""bom"" é o verdadeiro.De pontos negativos, além dos comandos serem complicados como no Bioshock 1, temos um respawn ridículo de inimigos. Sério, pelo menos pra mim deu muita raiva eu terminar de matar todos os Splicers, sair do local pra pegar um item e quando voltar pra área o lugar estar cheio de inimigos novamente.

Você pode ser um altruísta e tentar salvar as pessoas, você pode ser um sobrevivente que tenta apenas ficar vivo (não importa como), ou pode ser os dois. Cada um desses caminhos vai determinar o final do jogo.O elemento de terror nesse game foi utilizado de forma inteligente, tem horas que você tem medo de virar de costas, tem horas que você ouve barulhos e fica com receio de ir checar. Pode parecer besteira, mas eu joguei esse jogo de madrugada e tinham momentos em que eu realmente fiquei apavorado sjdfksl~sdk~lkA história é contada através dos Diários de Áudio, que são os poucos coletáveis existentes no jogo.

On n'était pas préparés. On aurait pu le prévoir, grâce à ses nobles ancétres (Morrowind et Oblivion) mais les gens ont préférés rester aveugles. Maintenant c'est trop tard...Skyrim.....Comment présenter ce jeu ? En disant que malgrés le fait qu'il soit sortit en 2011, il reste au top des ventes ?Non. Même ça ne pourrait vous y préparer.Donc allons-y, point par point.Les points forts des Elders Scrolls et de Skyrim particulierement, c'est l'univers: Tamriel. Le background trés poussé nous offre  une carte immense, des villes uniques, des dizaines de livres, des centaines de PNJ et surtout....des quêtes à la pelle.Car comme dans beaucoups de RPG, même si la quête principale est plutôt bien menée, elle ne reste qu'un fil conducteur. Le véritable attrait du scénario est donc les quêtes secondaires, tertiaires et diverses. Il est à noter qu'il ne faut jamais sous-estimer ces derniéres: on ne sait jamais jusqu'où elle vont nous mener! Qui sait, peut-être jusqu'aux dieux? Jusqu'au poste de Maitre de la Guilde des Voleurs ?Ce qui m'amene a ce qui est, selon moi, un des principaux défauts de Skyrim: le manque d'alignement. Le Roleplay n'est pas encouragé voir inexistant. Ce qui fait quand même bizarre dans un jeu de rôle. Dans le même style, je regrette l'absence de classes de personnage, mais certains au contraire trouve que ça ne rend le jeu que meilleur.J'arrive maintenant aux graphisme du jeu. Ben je n'ai rien a dire. Beaucoups se plaindront des textures mais j'encourage tout le monde a considerer que ce jeu est tout de même vieux de 3 ans. Et qu'il fait toujours le poid.Question gameplay: impecable. La vue a la troisieme personne est cependant relativement injouable par rapport à celle a la premiere personne.Et enfin: le workshop. Ou le Nexus. Ou la Confrerie des Traducteurs. Enfin ce genre de chose. Pour effacer tout les défauts,Pour rendre le jeu plus beau,C'est le workshop qu'il nous faut!Quel poéte je fait!     Enfin en un mot comme en cent: Un jeu incontournable qui séduit tout le monde, néophytes comme hardcore gamers, par son univer, ses quêtes, ses graphismes,sa musique, son gameplay....et surtout son workshop.Mais qui peut en décevoir certains par un jeu pas assez centré sur le RP. Quelques cinématiques ne seraient pas en trop non plus.Ah! Et j'aimerais aussi savoir ce que je foutait dans cette charrette.""}]",-0.8372

No entanto joguei antes de publicarem, quando havia como jogar se registrando no site.Bem, o jogo é bom. Sua \'economia\' nos gráficos não fazem o jogo ser ruim. Apesar de está em ""Acesso Antecipado"" o jogo não possui grandes bugs, no entanto, em alguns momentos o jogo parece um ""Walking Simulator"", já que o mapa mesmo sendo pequeno, faz você ficar andando muito tempo até chegar em alguma base/cidade para pegar os itens. Mas, como existem veiculos (que precisam de reparos e combustivel), é o melhor jeito de se locomover.Uma coisa também que é \'ruim\' é o número de pessoas no servidor, que até onde ví só suportam até 12 pessoas, e mesmo assim muitos servers contam com apenas 8 slots. O jogo também possui um sistema de construção, mas que não sei como funciona ainda. E tem outra, o jogo tem vários tipos de munições e magazine, que devem ser preenchidos com as munições, elevando a dificuldade de se ter armas de fogo. O Unturned também conta com um pouco do Rust, onde você pode montar sua propria base e craftar inumeros itens, mas ainda não cheguei a testar tudo.A inteligencia artificial dos zumbis é boa, mas, tem alguns pequenos bugs. Como por exemplo, alguns zombis não sobem em determinados objetos (como caixas, carros...). Mas em geral eles te seguem o tempo inteiro, impedindo até de mecher no inventário.

With that being said, the highlighted antagonist, Pagan Min, demonstrates qualities that draw your attention like none other. Unlike the average villain that vows to elimate all who oppose's them, Pagan has an unsettling relaxed-attitude that makes the player wonder of the extensive past of this individual, grasping your attention. Like Vaas, you feel the desire to learn more of this fanatic. Pagan and Vaas are also two very opposing characters in their own unique way, as they excell in certain areas of development, with their own seperate strengths and weaknesses. Far Cry's antagonist reputation-bar has been raised once again.In correspondence to Far Cry 3's protagonist, Jason Brody, the ravine-gap of development that would be expected going from zero-to-terminator  was once again crossed with the easy breeze of a parachute. All possible development stages for the protagonist were once again stripped, as you dawdle out of a building and endeavour upon your massacre, keeping in mind you've never had a glimpse of knowledge towards the combat field. This mistake was also apparent in Far Cry 3, although atleast Jason stopped himself after his first kill, and reflected upon his actions, then proceeded to clear two islands.Tl;Dr - If you loved Far Cry 3, you'll love this even more. Hail Kyra.""}]",-0.228

En el juego existen dos tipos de puntos de control, un punto de control temporal que funciona mientras estás en la partida, permitiendo que si algo sale mal el jugador aparezca en la última posición guardada, estos se reconocen cada vez que aparece el mensaje de guardar, pero por otro lado están los puntos de control para cuando se quiere retomar el juego, los cuales no son muy claros, porque cualquiera pensaría que cada vez que dice guardar está guardando esa posición para continuar desde ahí la próxima vez que se juegue, pero no, los puntos donde se guarda la partida por completo son al finalizar cada capítulo, y si no estoy mal, creo que en la gran mayoría de los casos eran cada vez que el niño se lanzaba por el tobogán. En mi caso tengo muchas horas de juego, y no precisamente porque me hubiera pasado dos veces el juego o porque realmente me hubiera demorado tanto en completarlo, sino porque como no guardaba en cualquier momento de la partida, en un momento que estaba jugando tuve que realizar otra cosa y me ocupé, por lo que me tocó dejar el juego andando en segundo plano con la finalidad de poder continuar más tarde y así no perder lo que ya llevaba.

It's at this point that the game stops being a survival game, an starts to be an unpaid fulltime job. See the promise of a survival game is that the longer you play, the more survivable & fun it becomes as you master your terrain. Ark on the other hand, the more work you put in, the more work there is to put in. Once you've built your house of straw, it's on to your house of wood, once you've got your house of wood, it's on to the house of stone & it's like that with literally everything in the game: There is no pay off.An if you are the least bit effective early on in the game, the leveling system outstrips the actual content, in that it stops being a survival game & rapidly becomes an eating, drinking & pooping simulator, because thats what you spend your entire time doing, as you wait for your xp to bring you up to the next level.As for the PVE aspects of the game they leave a lot to be desired. Dinosaurs just mill around, instead of moving with any purpose, and there are just way to heavily packed together on a map that is way to small. God help you if you don't stick to the beach the entire time, because predatory dinosaurs are so common place off the beach that it often feels like you are being Zerged by small predatory dinosaurs, or worse yet the insects.Which brings me to my next issue: Movement tracking. I don't mind combat with the dinosaurs, or at least i wouldn't if i ever got in to combat with the dinosaurs, rather than shadow boxing the fart of existance that the program thinks are the dinosaurs locations, when actually the dinosaur is three feet, that a way.The game lacks for telegraphing so dinos attack, before lacky banding back to the location they were in, without passing through the space between. The worst offenders are the spitting dinosaurs & the raptors, but it's alsoa problem with any of the insects, and even the Bronto's who kill you by magic apparently, because you'll never see what they hit you with. I'm sure there is a playable game under there somewhere, but it's not nearly as deserving of praise as it's currently getting.""}]",-0.5219

Z tą grą mam jednak spory kłopot. Z jednej strony jest to zdecydowanie Najlepsza część trylogii a z drugiej nie wiem czy powinna być pod marką Max Payne (TM). Gra mam wrażenie, że w 60% składa się z filmików i 40% z samej gry. Jednak sama gra ma bardzo dobry klimat z wyjątkiem misji w New Jersey, które są zbędne zupełnie. Dość dobrze postarzono bohatera, który wygląda na te swoje 48 lat (z nagrobka żony możemy wyczytać, iż zmarła w 1998 r. zaś urodziła się w 1964 i zakładam, że byli rówieśnikami z Maxem), ma już sporo zmarszczek i siwiznę. I znowu trochę dziegciu, bo człowiek, który topił przez 14 lat smutki w alkoholu zmieszanym z lekami przeciwbólowymi, zwyczajnie tyle by nie przeżył. Znam takie przypadki i na pewno Max wyglądałby bardziej jak 60latek lub poprostu umarłby przez ten czas. Gra przypomina skrzyżowanie filmów akcji - Szklanej Pułapki z Zabójczą Bronią. Do tego widać, że autorzy czerpali inspirację nawet nie garściami a wręcz wiadrami z filmów Tropa de Elite 1 i 2. Humor w grze jest szczątkowy. Fabuła i intryga nie porywają. Są przewidywalne. To są jedne z wielu elementów gry, które mnie zarówno przyciągają jak i odstręczają. Plusy: - Bardzo dobry klimat Brazylii czy szerzej Ameryki Południowej - Postać Bohatera i dość dobrze oddany jego wiek - Świetny Max z brodą i ogoloną na łyso głową, choć przypomina Bruce\'a Willis\'a :) - Dobra grafika, bez zacięć nawet na nie nowym sprzęcie (kolorowa, ciepła sceneria) - Dobrze wykonane modele oraz lokacje - Inspiracja BARDZO dobrymi filmami brazylijskimi - Ciekawe postacie w tle - Dla niektórych oldschoolowe apteczki (dragi) - Favele i strzelanie do Sao Paolowej wersji BOPE :) - Bronie używane w policji brazylijskiej (niestety nielicencjonowane) - FANTASTYCZNA muzyka! Minusy: - Poziom trudności miejscami absurdalny.- Strzelanie do lecących rakiet i granatów?(!) - Brak autoleczenia na easy i zastosowania painkillerów na wyższych poziomach - Mało ""gry w grze"" bo większość to prerenderowane filmiki BINK choć na bazie engine gry. - Miejscami potwornie męcząca i powtarzalna - Za mało check pointów lub własnych saveów. - Praca kamery, czasami głowa Maxa zasłania celowniczek :/ - Fabuła trochę zbyt oklepana i bez zaskakujących zwrotów akcji - Czasami konieczność przeczytania walkthrough aby dowiedzieć się jak przejść niektóre etapy na poziomach od 12 do 14 (bossowie) Podsumowując. Grę zmęczyłem. Do 12 poziomu grało się mało frustrująco ale ostatnie 3 poziomy czasem powodowały chęć skasowania gry. Gra jest inna niż poprzednie MP ale dla mnie to akurat plus. Bardzo dobrze gra się w upalnym klimacie i jest zdecydowanie ciekawszy niż zimne NJ. Mimo to, grało się na tyle dobrze, że chęć ukończenia przeważyła nad frustracją. Warto zaznaczyć, że nie jest to gra do przechodzenia na więcej niż raz.

Problem polega na tym, iż o ile CoD4 MW miał zarówno fantastyczną, nowatorską i nawet jakoś w miarę wiarygodną kampanię, bardzo dobrą grafikę jak i świetny tryb multi, o tyle MW2 było potwornym rozczarowaniem. Fatalna kampania, absolutnie nie wiarygodne pomysły. Do CoD MW3 podszedłem więc z dużą dawką sceptycyzmu, wyuczonego już na kampanii BF3. Ktoś, kiedyś napisał, że ""co druga gra z serii Call of Duty jest udana"" i chyba faktycznie tak jest. Przejście kampanii zajęło mi ok 6h. Tym niemniej, to co na mnie zrobiło jakieś wrażenie to to, iż w MW3 historia jest o wiele ciekawsza niż w MW2. Po drugie, jest zdecydowanie dłuższa a już w porównaniu z BF3 wydaje się niemal ""gigantycznie"" długa. Oczywiście, można i należy mieć zastrzeżenia co do wiarygodności opowieści z kampanii (żenujący wątek jednego ubermencha, który rozpętuje wojnę między dwoma mocarstwami - jeszcze w MW2), na pewno totalny brak zrozumienia twórców gry dotyczący strategii defensywnej NATO i Rosji, skutków użycia broni masowego rażenia i odpowiedzi drugiej strony, wreszcie zupełna ignorancja dotycząca prowadzenia wojny nuklearnej oraz strategii Odstraszania.

CoD4 był jednak nowatorski, stąd taki sposób liczenia przyjąłem) - przestarzała grafika - skrypty, skrypty, skrypty - nadal bieganie w rurze - przeciwnicy mają AI na poziomie ameby, biegając wprost pod lufę i to falami - inwazja Rosji na USA od strony Atlantyku? (abstrahuję od tego, że wymagałoby to kilku milionów żołnierzy oraz tysięcy statków pływających w tę i z powrotem po północnym Atlantyku, zupełnie nie niepokojonych amerykańskimi i brytyjskimi OP w rejonie GIUK) - idiotyczny pomysł jakoby ktoś był w stanie pokonać ochronę i porwać tej klasy VIPa - użycie broni chemicznej i brak strategicznej odpowiedzi NATO na jej uzycie - inwazja i zajęcie przez Rosję połowy Europy, po czym nie wiadomo skąd przybywają czołgi Bundeswehry - upadki, wypadki, katastrofy najróżniejszego typu, a gracz wstaje i otrzepuje się jakby wypadek śmigłowca był upadkiem z roweru - dlaczego Rosjanie używają RPG7 (nie mając ich już obecnie na wyposażeniu frontowym) do walki ze śmigłowcami jeśli mają tysiące rakiet Strieła-3, Igła-1 i Igła-S? - nie zrozumiałe użycie SOFLAM w jednej z misji - myśliwce latają między śmigłowcami, zupełnie nie mając wpływu na lot tych ostatnich (same turbulencje są już niebezpieczne, ale twórcy chyba nie zauważyli tej kwestii) - absolutnie chory system konsolowych QTE w finale. - finał jednak rozczarowuje, choć mogło być gorzej... OCENA: 8/10 uważam za sprawiedliwą ocenę Kampanii. Gra nie jest zła, kampania jest wciągająca, względnie długa, choć niestety nie ma nic nowatorskiego. Tym niemniej gra się dobrze i satysfakcjonuje mimo wszystko o wiele bardziej niż MW2. Uważam CoD MW3 za dobry zakup i choć nie opisuję wrażeń z MP, to myślę, że BF3 i MW3 uzupełniają się, pierwszy ciekawszym MP a drugi lepszą kampanią. Obie gry mają zalety i wady. Nie można ich zakwalifikować do średniaków, mimo wtórności MW3 czy słabej kampanii BF3, ale też żadna nie wnosi nic przełomowego ani odkrywczego.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 24.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '209650', 'helpful': '2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""DON'T BUY IT.

I still can't find anything so  appealing to so many people in this game.  Boring, bad story, cliched, too much shooting and not enough dialogs. Oh and characters are just screaming to get to know them better but there are basicaly no dialogs. Well its not Quantum Dreams game  anyways. So, should you play it?

I bought the second season of TWD in may and after first episode i dropped it for a couple of months. I just finished it yesterday. Well, unfortunately this sequel is suffering from the same illness that AMC TWD series has. It started great in first season and each season is changing the show from survival show to soap opera. This game is suffering from this as well. It's not as thrilling as first season. Story is dull, boring, dialogs are uniteresting and in some cases scenes are too long and static like the one where characters talk by camp fire in Ep4. The characters, oh my. In sequel I found only one  character fairly interesting beside Clementine - it's Jane. Other characters are just lame. I didn't care about what would happen to them or if they die or not. This kind of Visual Novel (yes, its nothing more) at least should be based on good story and strong characters. But its not. Appart of lame characters, bad story, crappy dialogs there is not much game in game. You just don't play much. This sequel is based on ABSURD number of TERRIBLE QTEs. If you like hitting a keyboard key like  a frenzy monkey then go ahead play it. If not, then this game is going to be a torture for you. The choices in this game as in first season are simply just a detour to the linear story. In first season it was hidden much better, because the story was better. To show you how bad second season is I dare to say, that each short episodes of Season 1 DLC 400 days was MUCH more interesting than whole second season! What a shame that TellTale made this sequel. After finishing it I am not going to buy nex season if they make it at all. I do not believe this dev anymore and I am pretty sure, the will be pushing strong for their own DRM of which I am not a fan. So the final verdict. If you must have every game about Zombies buy it.If you are TWD fan, don't buy it.First season was imho 9/10400 days was decent 7/10Second season is well below average game, so:3/10.

But DIE adds its own unique game modes and customisation. The workbenches bring a crafting element into the game that sees the player collecting resources and leveling both their own levels and the level of the workbench itself. Once a player has collected or bought the blueprints for weapons and collected all the required resourses they can be crafted to give an edge to the player in game. Of course with all free to play games real money can be used to short cut around collecting resourses and saving up for characters. With a lot of time the end game can be reached without having to spend any money at all, but the experience and money recieved is miniscual compared to what can be bought with real money. The game modes available are Co-Op and PVP each having a few maps and difficulty varients. The co-op mode sees the player teaming up with three players to defeat an army of zombies, the hardest difficulty requires all player to be present in order to have any chance of defeating the final boss, in my experience people leave these games all the time and then you end up having to leave the game because it is impossible to win at low levels, granting no experience or money and ends up being a massive waste of time. For this reason I would not recomend playing the co-op modes in the mid levels and just sticking to the PVP game modes that are available. The standard game mode sees the player joining a team of four and facing up against two other teams of four in a 'scavanger' hunt that uses capturing objectives and killing zombie bosses to gain resourses, this game mode is fun but later on in the game a team can easily destroy the turret guarding the resourses and just steal all of the winning teams resourses, it should be a bit harder to destroy these turrets or at all in my opinion.Overall this game is great and sees story and art from the Dead Island series being brought into a well executed and unique MOBA game""}]",-0.9903

First, I froze to death in the night, second, I fell off a cliff after getting hopelessly lost in a blizzard.Third time. I was living in a hut that provided a decent amount of food and fuel. I wanting to set snares for rabbits, so I travelled north to a little shack, set my snares and settled down in the shack for a little bit. Blizzard came, so I decided to stay in the hut for a bit longer, when I checked the snare, it was completely destroyed by the storm, it was too late to head back home, so I stayed in the hut for another, well aware that I was out of tinder and running out of food. Next morning, I start sprinting home and soon a wolf starts chasing me. Weaponless as I was, I high-tailed it out of there, and managed to get home. I took apart some furniture for a fire and drank a LOT. Starting to starve, I decided to head out and see if I could scavenge anything. I found some railroad tracks and followed them. Eventually I saw a decent looking building, with a wolf prowling nearby. Brandishing my torch, I was surprised when the wolf didnt bolt immediatly, so I sprinted into the house. No food, Nowhere. My only hope of getting food before I starved to death, would be to tackle the wolf. So I went outside and sure enough, the wolf was still there, prowling around in the fading light. I ran at it, and managed to beat it, but it ran away. I tried to follow, but I was too injured. After healing, I saw crows flying up in the sky, like the do when they find a carcass. So I went to them, and found a deer carcass. I took its meat and cooked that up. I finally had a small meal, but I was slowly dying from exhaustion, so i rolled out my bag and tried to sleep for an hour. As I started to wake up, I could sniffling, and I knew the wolf had found me again. Once again I managed to fend it off, but I had run out of medical supplies. I decided I would try and run, but I turned around just in time to see the wolves jaws snapping right in my face.

Acho que para mim, o que mais adorei no jogo foi toda aquela atmosfera dos lugares. Esse jogo te faz se sentir jovem de novo, retratando temas muito legais como a amizade, a família, o futuro. Eu me senti muito feliz jogando-o, A sutileza que você entra as relações dos personagens te faz lembrar da sua época da adolescência, basicamente, você se sente jovem novamente ao ver as coisas acontecerem na perspectiva da protagonista (Max).Para a proposta do jogo, a jogabilidade é bacana e eficiente, não tenho muito que reclamar.Os gráficos não são ultra realisticos (da pra ver), mas mesmo assim, você enxerga uma direção de arte maravilhosa, uma coisa única, que pra mim enriqueceu o jogo.Acho que também devo as vozes do jogo, dando uma carga muito dramática, ou seja, ESSE JOGO TE PEGA NO EMOCIONAL. O plot dele é muito dramático, (coisa que vimos de mais no cinema), mas eu gostei mesmo assim.Vale muito a pena, uma delícia, o ruim é que ele é um daqueles jogos que quando você zera, você fica uma semana pensando e se perguntando o que fazer da vida...Quase esquecendo, ele toca nos temas da juventude tão bem, é como se fosse um ""Clube dos Cinco"" ou ""As Vantagens de ser Invisível"" dos games, incrívelNem vou falar da trilha sonora, que é 10/10.

Wasn\'t as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn\'t bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn\'t too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, ""Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!""-pls excuse bad inggris.'}]",-0.9448

Overview\t Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO or GO for short) is an online tactical and first-person shooter. The aim of the game depends on the game mode. Game modes consist of modes like Demolition and Hostage Rescue. Modes\t In Demolition, the Terrorists (T for short) have to plant a bomb at one of two sites, Site A or Site B. The Counter-Terrorists (CT for short) have to stop the Terrorists by erradicating the enemy team. Each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800, which they can buy other weapons and gear with. As you progress through the game, winning or losing, you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons. The first to win 16 rounds wins.In Hostage Rescue, the Terrorists most ""protect"" the hostages from the Counter-Terrorists while the Counter-Terrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap. If either team erradicates the other, they win.In Casual, your rank is not affected by your wins/loses. Other modes, like surfing and ""Cas Team Deathmatch"" are in here.  Ranks\t   Catagory ScoreStatement   Gameplay 9Gameplay is fun and quick, however, it can get really intense at times, making it more fun!   Graphics 7Graphics are a plus for this addition to the Counter-Strike series. It is a very good looking game to play in.   Teamwork 9Teamwork is esential in this game, otherwise, the game is ruined.

The in-game menu is extremely limited, cluttering your screen with oversized button for some things, such as how to spend real-world money, while leaving other buttons, notably those to do with other people and closing smaller menus, incredibly small. Furthermore, the game gives you NO INSTRUCTION WHATSOEVER on how to do anything but gameplay. while it does instruct basic gameplay rather well, it doesn\'t matter if you can\'t find your way into a match. While the game does also give you links to guides and intructions by other players on YouTube, these guides and instructions are outdated, and differ (a lot) from what the game is now. However, the gameplay is quite good, and the menus can be navigated with some practice. The major downside is the social system.Edit: I found how to add friends.

You get a couple puzzles here and there but they are extremley easy and really pathetic, and obviously the game's story is not immersive at all! Go here, do that. Do that, go here.

I know so many other games that compared to this are better, more fun and actually give you bang for your buck. Some of these are: Pretty much any game on the PS2, GTA series, Red dead redemption, Far cry series, Mortal Kombat, Prototype, Battlefield series, there are so many games that absolutley crush this game and are a lot more fun.

No has been compensated in any way, and this broken, unfinished mess is now being touted as a complete game.As for the specific issues with the game:PROS-1. It is a 4X game played in real time. That allows for a number of new strategies not possible in the ordinarily turn-based genre.2. Stardrive brought something new to the 4X table with the ability to design/fit your ships from scratch. This was the core pulling factor of the game. With customizable ships, you could choose from a pre-existing hull and redesign the ship to suit whatever specialised need. Titanic capital ships dedicated to bombing a planet into a foetid hellhole (i.e. conducting Exterminatus)? Done. Beam cannons on a fighter? No problemo. Or how about a logistics ship to provide repairs to your fleet on the go? All possible.CONS-1. The Sunburn engine is a laggy unoptimized mess. The framerate basically commits suicide during mid to late game, and especially in the middle of large fleet battles involving more than a hundred ships, even more so with the fact that the game runs in real time. The devs took a bad gamble opting to use a new engine with little repute, and lost.2. The AI is shallow at best, and in the state the devs had left the game, you can\'t do much more than basic threatening, bargaining, and decaring war. Some of the interaction options do not even seem to have any real purpose or effect.3. The game claims to be mod-friendly, however due to the limitations of the engine it can only run 1 mod at any time.4. Planetary interaction with colonies and ground troops could truly be better. Every ground unit across all the playable races are basically just reskins of one another, and the gameplay lacks any sort of strategic depth beyond throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy (or as many as you can fit on the map). Building placement doesn\'t appear to have any strategic element either.5. Finally, the game devs abandoned the sinking ship while all the passengers were still on board. Didn\'t say a word. One day they just went *poof*, and no one heard from them again until they began advertising their ""new"" game.\'nuff said.Such a pity, really. This game had so much promise....'}]",-0.9624

There are better dungeon crawlers out there although for a turn-based one it does things pretty well. My three major gripes with it are the Hunger System, Attack System and the Item System.Hunger is bull, it's hard enough keeping your health up but having to go out of your way to search a level that may or may not have any food on it is stupid, either remove the system or reduce the frequency of its occurences because the Item System isn't helping either.The Item System is interesting, the fact that with Potions, Armour and Weapons you don't know what will happen until you try it is cool, I really like that feature and find it a bit humourous when I drink a potion not thinking to just throw it first and then self-igniting myself. The issue with this system is that the items are rare and sparce, you may go through an entire level and pick up maybe 2-3 items (excluding Dew Drops and Seeds but they're not that useful). Also I often find that it's only after I reach level 3 usually that I actually have a new Sword and Armour, it's annoying that it's that far down and the enemies can do near identical damage to you which makes it a real pain when you just need a Healing Potion or some better armour but you can't get to it because you keep getting killed before you can find any, because the items are so rare in this game.The last one, and I swear to eveyone's based god, the most crippling one to this game, the attack system. The attack system is absolute crap, you will miss more times than you will hit, while your enemies will hit nearly all the time. I can understand with an enemy like the Wraith, as its a ghost that it's hard to hit but when I start at full health with a Healing Potion and can't hit this guy once before dying, that's too far and the Wraith don't even do that much damage so it was a good 12-20 hits. The other thing is that enemies are almost random with the amount of damage they do, I've fought rats that'll deal 1 and 2 damage and I was thinking that I was going to kill it and then it deals a 5 and I'm dead, seriously, the second level introduces this enemy, I can't remember the name for but looks like a squirrel-sort of and it deals a consecutive 3-4 damage almost all the time where I'm luck to land a 6 on them. It's such a pain getting killed by a single creature and it's so annoying when the only thing it says above the enemy is evaded, evaded, evaded, dodged, dodged, evaded. It's painful to watch something like that happen.So if you want a game that'll kill you within 4 levels with no more than 30 enemies get this game, but if your looking for a genuinly fun and enjoyable Dungeon Crawler where each venture is very different, then keep looking because this game is relentless.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 11, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '4000', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Brilliant Game, very fun and very diverse in game modes.

Tetering on the brink, neither way I steer the wheels has any positive effect, and both forwards and backwards torque sink the lower wheels deeper and edge the truck further towards tipping point. There are no practical winch points anywhere. At last, some forward forward momentum. I might make it out of this after all, and deliver this last load to the lumber yard. The truck falls over, and the engine stalls, but All is not lost - The logs are still in the cart. I try restarting the engine. It stalls again.I walk back to the garage and get in my truck with a crane attatchment. If I can get the crane truck close enough, a combination of winch and crane might just do the trick. I traverse the boggy and hazardous road between the garage and the tipped log truck as night begins to fall. Upon reaching it, I realise that I'm going to have to get the crane truck into a narrow gap between the log truck and the edge of the nearby forest. And to get there I'm going to have to get through the same bog that I got the first truck stuck in, and move the truck most of the way into the forest. Here goes.10 minutes later, The rescue mission is a failure. The rescue truck was able to get into position into the forest after many turns and wheel revolutions, but now is stuck between two trees with no hope of getting out. The load of logs was spilt after the first attempt to winch the truck back to vertical failed, and now it's out of range of the rescue truck's winch and crane.I walk back to the garage, where my emergency fuel tanker lies waiting, and get the mechanics there to remove the fuel tank and install another crane. While they do this, I have a cup of tea and a vodka or two, while deliberating what to do with the stuck vehicles. Remembering that one of the local towing companies owns an eight wheeler missile truck that they picked up for cheap from a corrupt government official, I decide to just pick up the logs and carry them to the destination, leaving the two trucks stuck in the meantime. The money I get from this job will be able to pay for the towing and repairs for the other two trucks. I go back over to the mechanics and get them to put a log trailer on as well.I arrive at the aparrent scrapyard and assess the situation. It's not as bad as it seems as the logs have fallen and rolled near some fairly stable piece of ground. The loading process goes without a hitch and I set off towards the lumber yard. Everything goes smoothly right until the entrance to the lumber yard. Here, the road is narrow, and I find the exact same thing that happened to the first truck happening again. No problems, I've been through this before, I know how to fix it. Winch onto the nearest tree, and use the extra pulling force to get at least my front wheel out. The truck starts to tip. I detach the winch. I try driving forward. Truck starts tipping further. Into reverse. Ah, some movement, but due to the direction I have to steer in, the trailer starts to jacknife horribly. Still, I push it as far as I can, and realign my front wheels after surveying the ground again. There's a way to the left, but it's between two trees that are in close proximity. The trees do damage to my trailer, but no considerably, and in return they stop my trailer from tipping again. I get through, park in the lumber yard, unload the lumber, then take another swig of vodka. Time to find the number of that towing guy.$30 is cheap.""}]",-0.975

But playstyle is the true casualty here. The combat from the 2cnd game heck even the first has been taken out, stripped for parts, ♥♥♥♥♥ with a hammer than lazily slopped back in -easily the worst of the franchise their is no variation u have to go in guns blazing full board with no other option. enemy ai will not allow for control or long range options they will charge your position or grenade spam and their is nothing u can do about it -cover is worthless this time round and any slam or grenade hits will send you flying due to gravity.Gravity is the absolute worst mechanic ever introduced into a fps, it ruins everything it touches in this game, the lack of atmosphere makes exploration painful and not worth the effort, the use of said atmo in combat and the forced nature of its use is just extra frustration, the jump mechanics to get it to work can be fiddly and again frustrating with fire being able to knock u out or lock u into a low burn so very easily. the slightest hit with a nade or slam will throw u from cover and often off of cliffs or walls -into hazards etc with nothing u can do about it. lunatics this games versions of psycos especially can just be a pain to deal with as they rush ur position and spam ground slams.Vehicles, this game introduces 2 new ones and they are shocker -absolutely terrible, the game throws ALOT of vehicle jumps at u especially early on but the first car can barely make any of them and will often just zoom straight off into the beyond -the game gives u the 2cnd vehicle early and while it can make the jumps its this lame as slow wanna be bike or speeder thing -just soo much fail.Finally the laser weapons -my god f the damn laser weapons -in a players hands they are terrible ammo horing weapons dealing little damage per ammo but in the enemy hands they will rend your sheilds and health faster than a rocket round, the ai is extremelly acurate as they are in all borderlands and these enemies can fly and manipulate the gravity it's just frustration to deal with them with all the other factors in play.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 26, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '247830', 'helpful': '6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""This game could have been great, but unfortunately the pay to win/compete factor rears it's ugly head -the game looks and controls fantastic unfortunately ships cost over 7k in game currency, crew cost over 7k in game currency -average currency gain for a win is 30-50 and thats not even going anywhere what shells cost and that they are one shot uses per buy.The number of ships and crew is disappointing, exceedingly low for a game of this type and with the ships most are not even buyable until you have reached a certain lv or gained an acheivment.The game is severely lacking in an offline capactiy, even online there should still be a decent ai option and tho it's there it's very barebones with dumb ai and little reward for spendign the time on. no campaign to speak of, the game starts out looking liek it will have a decent story and mission mechanic but you get to the league unlock it and the games like there you go now give us money.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 19, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '351640', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""This is just a real gem, the graphics are very pretty for something under 200mb, the story is fantastic, the gameplay is fantastic and it's flippin free.seriously why are you still reading this, download this game!""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 15, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '213670', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""The gross out humor, political wit and just about every form of negative sterotyping is in full south park swing so if you don't like south park avoid this game, if you do despite a relatively short exp you will be replaying this game for days finding all the referances and nods to the show.As an rpg it stands up very well, playing very similiar to paper mario with a mature twist to the attack styles, visualy it looks like it was cut dierectly from the tv show which is actually pretty impressive and the story is fantastic even if some of the scenes go a bit too far but hey thats south park :3.There is a anti-censer patch in the forums and if you have no friends in america that can buy then gift it to you I would strongly recommend downloading and installing it.

If you do have a girlfriend, I recommend not playing this game because it encourages aggression on the other hand, if your girlfriend likes BDSM all for it. Also, this game dissolves relationships among your friends and promotes being an a55hole. For example, my friend who complains about CS;GO and how he is held back and blames his team mates has now become alot more aggresive and annoying in real life. CS;GO is bad for our youth and encourages offensive language and behavior.There are 4 types of people who play CSGO:1. The Competitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (me)2. The Casuals3. The Surfers4.

If you need anything make a post on the forums and I\'ll probably be there.The upperpart of my review is of the game below that I will address the points of some of the negative reviews.Darkest Dungeon is fairly straightforward, multiple heroes with varying skills and abilities that you send off to a dark lovecraftian dungeon to fend off creatures battling to keep your health, hunger and sanity in check. In a sense it plays a little like an old Final Fantasy game, but without any pheonix downs and every monster matters.There are four seperate dungeons (and then the end game dungeon) that each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses and thus who you send into each area is often unique. As you select your four heroes you need to make some tough decisions. Will you send the Plague doctor? The only hero to boast both a double stun and double poison skill. The Bounty Hunter who can uppercut your enemies into different ranks? Or a mighty Man at Arms who can guard another while boosting his own defense and then next round can activate a counter attack! Rather than just a simple ""Me am warrior me am stronk!"" teams who can work together and take out the nasty healers and stress dealers, who hide in the back rank, fast and first will leave the dungeon sane while the slow teams with very little reach into the back rows will teem with madness and disease.Darkest Dungeon features a fairly linear weapon and armor system (coupled with some reasonable D&D type factors in how speed and other mechanics work) but offers a unique trinket system that can spice up combat. A disease and quirk system, diseases are obviously bad while quirks come in good and bad qualities.The final piece is the stress system, while dungeoneering your Heroes will gain stress through various means, will they crack under pressure? Or will they stand steady as a beacon of hope?In its entirety the game offers a well known system but adds several unique mechanics to really make it stand out.I would highly recommend anyone interested in this game but still unsure to watch some playthroughs on youtube.Also, check out some of the reviews with large comment chains and you\'ll see downvoters calling upvoters ""shills"". They\'re absolutely paranoid that people can like this game. It\'s pretty funny.For a while I thought this game was too hard, that I was doing everything right and that RNG was screwing me over.Then I got gud and realized that I had everything wrong. It is tough and RNG will kick you while you\'re down but many of these downvotes are blatant lies and I would like to address them here.""You lose 10-20 hours per character that dies"" I have lost about 4 max rank characters, and a few rank 3-4 ones aswell, at time of posting this I have 88 hours gameplay. My roster is almost full of max rank characters and I beat the game. The roster has 28 slots (+12 due to end game reasons), by his/her maths I\'d need about 400-800 hours to do that.""I was 1-hit by a non crit"" utter lies. Maybe, just maybe, they had a plague doctor in the front row with double -HP trinkets... but why have some one who is essentially protected by a tissue and as weak as a kitten in that situation and then act like it\'s not your fault when a GIANT hits you?Many, many of the complaints are ""I don\'t have a good team set up and I can\'t hit some one at the back!"" Well that\'s probably their fault for bringing three units who can only hit the front two ranks and a healer.Several complaints are that the characters aren\'t equally powered and some outshine others, but I 100% believe the characters are extremely well balaned - it\'s all about using the characters correctly. For example the Plague Doctor isn\'t supposed to deal damage like a crusader/leper or heal HP like a Vestal, but a support class that can stun and poison (even two people at once) and stop heavy bleed/poison damage. Many - if not most - the complaints come from an update that causes stops enemies at the back from instantly moving forward when you kill a front unit. So rather than an open varied team they get upset their insanely powerful double leper set up (that guy 100% strongest solo character) can\'t just one hit everything.I have felt their pain but I can gaurantee that many of the complaints are biased and just frustrated that they couldn\'t get it right - even the forums get ""I attacked Wilbur and my characters said \'No don\'t do that you\'re upsetting the big one\' and then the big one got angry WTF RNG I AM LEET PRO"" (youtube darkest dungeons wilbur fails).I am not saying that their reviews are without merit, but the devolopers have made leaps and bounds to meet in the middle.Now you can hire higher leveled heroes, bonus XP under certain conditions and some units bring resources for dungeons and even a new class that adds some risk V reward.And if all else fails, ask for help on the forums. I sure have, the people there are (mostly) friendly and are willing to help.I have yet to find a bug or skill working improperly.If you find flaw within my review (and my review of negative reviews) please feel free to criticize or offer advice.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 7, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited March 19.', 'item_id': '299480', 'helpful': '13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""I think the fact that most of the positive comments come from people with less than 10 hours, some less than four hours, show that this game just isn't really worth it.As for everyone downvoting this, check out all those below one hour gameplay good reviews, there's like three over 10 hours.

I think you can turn it off, but it\'s still a head ache and then just becomes earily quiet as you listen to the great advance of... nothing.The AI is painful.Being shot at by cannons? Your crew will visit the roof. Raining that causes morale to drop? Roof visits for everybody! I just wish I could tell them to sit down a little easier.Or the guy with a fishing rod must stand on the right most corner block at the highest height possible, on the side you get attacked on. Why can\'t I tell him to stand on the good, safe, side?And all that fish... useless, everyone just dies of scurvy and refuses to eat the fruit you have so you just go out for excess fruit and never bother fishing.There are some things that people can use to increase stats/XP gain but they kept leaving to go do other things, I just want them to stay where I told them.I had 15 chickens constantly leaving fecal matter, I had their cages and I kept them until they leveled enough to lay eggs. I still have the two eggs that they laid (and I had them for several hours). After those two they refused to do anything.As far as teaching them skills, you almost always need cleaning because there is so much filth everywhere, swimming because insta-death sucks and before you know it almost everyone is practically a clone with skills that aren\'t so much choices but needs.I even spent 15 minutes not knowing why a ship of mine wasn\'t considered sea worthy just because I had a piece of backdrop in a place that they couldn\'t reach. The backdrop doesn\'t actually do anything besides look pretty, imagine your pirate ship not being allowed out because of a colour you chose. And the \'problem indicator\' just showed the highest right-most block rather than showing me the problem.The weapons are either great or useless with little in-between. Through use or stones you can level them, either level 10, 25 or 50. But for so, so many weapons it\'s a useless waste of time or if it is useful a grind. Many have effects that aren\'t really useful because the weapon sucks. Weapons from stores also seem to display incorrect info? (Stores also sometimes don\'t display the in depth item info such as damage/DPS/stats/etc on certain items).The fights are just your guys rushing them, healing is a bit of a pain.And to travel from one place to the other you have to wait for your characters to get there, you can increase their speed with items but it is so tedious especially the first hour or so since you can\'t go too far from town or else risk running out of provisions.All in all the start to mid game was nice with none of these problems being that bad but as the game went on it stopped being fun to play.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 18, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '227680', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'It had potential but fails to deliver.

The addition of two new playable factions, those being the Tau (Space commies with Mech suits and angry rooster people) and my personal favorite faction in all of 40k, The Necrons (Spooky scary skeleton robots), of course all the previous factions return with a new unit or two (Imperial guard get weapon teams, Chaos now lets you turn your lord into a daemon prince, etc)This game also adds a new between-battle map screen where you can upgrade your commader, train an honor guard, reniforce captured provinces and, of course, attack your enemy. Most of the battles are just basic multiplayer style skirmishs against the computer (with the exception of some missions that give you a space port or a daemons fury) but, in the heart of the enemy lines, there is a more mission based level, much like the previous games, that if you can conquer, that faction will be removed from the game, an you'll most likly get a wargear out of it too.Out of all the 40k games I have played, this is probably the best and most lore faithful (with the exception of the necron/human mix the Parias, they're gone now), sure it plays nothing like the table-top game, but lets be honest here.

The difference? Instead of just being a landmass, the battle map is an ENTIRE DAMN SOLAR SYSTEM.The Expansion also adds two new Factions. Namely the Dark Eldar (Fallen Eldar slavers) and the SIsters of battles (Space Nuns with power armour). Both of these new factions have their quirks, with the Dark Eldar gaining a reasource for their special abilites from haresting their foes Corpses, and the Sisters Gaining both power and faith the more of a specific building you have.However, removeing those new races the expansion is basicly the same as dark crusade but with two new races and over many planets instead of just one. The game only has one other merit of note. That being the new unit\'s Voice workIT IS SO BAD AND I LOVE IT. As i mentioned at the start of this review, the Space Marine Boreale\'s voice actor has a bit of an accent with makes his speech so damn funny (Bhatal Bruvas, Spess Marhens, Steal Rein!).

It's hard, but not unfairly hard like in Super Meat Boy or something like that. The game gives you tools and tells you you need to do X. Now I found doing was the easy part. I just had no idea how to do the procedures. So overall, this game is good for a laugh, you feel great once you finish a procedure and it provides a unique control system to master.

Actually, everything but the shotgun is. For every single weapon, excluding the shotgun, there was a time I was yelling at the game. Really, many of the puzzles aren't fair due to how the weapons work. It could easily be fixed by say, removing a set of spikes or telling us the slingshot isn't like the shotgun.The glitches: Bosses would freeze or you could fall off the map of another after a respawn.The death mechanics:Spikes: Respawn on the last horizontal surface you touched.Pits: Respawn on the last horizontal surface.Fire: Restart map.Fall off the map: Whatever it feels like. To make a good game, you have one mechanic. Not two. This game learned from Meat Boy that games with a high potential of death need to have a quick and easy respawn as the respawn wait time doesn't enrage players. This also rewards players for doing one difficult jump. Something like Meat Boy would make you do it all again. However, you get to the hard bosses and you find you've been spoon-fed. From the mole onwards, fire is introduced. Or at least map restarts. You find due to the terrible beam cannon that unless you jumped vertically, you were more likely to go straight into the fire. And with most of the late bosses, I had no idea what to do. The boss I hated most was the one of the candyland. It had two ramps leading down. Now that's all fine, but the stages never have invisible walls. Walk too far off the left or right and you fall to your death. For that level (which involved going up and down ramps at high speed), it was likely that using the beam cannon to get you up higher would roll you off the map, causing the map to restart. This enraged me as the battle went slowly to use the new mechanic it introduced.Other levels that were unforgiving, however, were always short. That's a plus for me.The good bits:The story is stupid. It had me laughing. The personality is great. The entire point of the game is great. It's fun. Basically, everything else I haven't whinged about. Well, either good or tolerable in perspective.TL;DRThe game is bugged.The game is unfair due to bugs and design.This game could be fixed with some changes to map design and death mechanics.The game handles like a flash game.The story is funny.The game is original.Both were enough for me to enjoy it.New mechanics were added and were enjoyable.Play the demo to see if you like it. http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/558562""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 27, 2011.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '26900', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""I have played this game for an hour and a half.

Your time will be spent walking through fields, looking at low textured walls and hillsides untill someone you cant see, either its due to poor render distance and resolution or theyre just straight up the master of disguise, pushes your brain out of your skull. When this game does go well it is at best a lot of shooting at areas where you think enemies might be, until you are killed and forced to spawn across the map and run all the way back because your squad leader forgot to put down a spawn beacon. Just do yourself a favour, if you want big open spaces and to pretend to be a 'real soldier', play arma. If you want devastating gunplay with walls and surfaces with actual textures, play Insurgency.

Another point to make is that I understand these free games need to make money but making people have to pay money for grenades is just stupid. The higher classes lay waste to the recruit classes and shotguns can destroy from any range (any). It plays very much like an unfinished game.

Paying ingame is optional, and can give an unfair advantage over those who don\'t wish to spend more, but you can still get perks without paying. Commanders play an essential role in the game, giving special buffs and units, such as.... TIGERS!!!! ELEPHANTS!!!! IS-2!!!!! KV-2!!!! Generally, the later perks cost more, but are more effective. You get these better perks by earning EXP and killing enemy units and capturing points. On the subject of points, these are where you get your resources from. To capture a point, you have to send a unit inside a certain area. In certain gamemodes, to win you must capture ""Victory points"", which take points from the enemy, resulting in their eventual demise. Another gamemode, Annihlation, you must destroy the enemy headquaters.

It was a solid team based FPS with an interesting variety of classes and many weapons and items for all of said classes. It seemed great. After a while of playing it, I have realised how boring it is.My problem is that really to have fun, you need to have lots of these weapons to add variety (because otherwise it is repetitive). The only problem is that you have to earn these weapons or trade for them - and by the time you\'ve done all that (which is, again, repetitive and boring), you are tired of playing the game anyway because all you\'ve done is sit around and trade or do the exact same thing over and over.Then there are the people that you may encounter in the servers:Mic-spammers.High-pitched annoying people (raging or asking to trade mostly).Spawn Campers.Etc.(But that stuff is usually on all games with a mic or whatever)I would recommend this game if I felt that you didn\'t  have to earn the fun rather than just get into the game and have fun right away. Pros: Well-done team-based gameplay.9 classes to choose from.Plenty of weapons, cosmetics.Still updated and maintained.Great art style.Haven\'t seen a single hacker. Cons: Earning items is a repetitive and boring task. (You are usually automatically considered a noob when you have no cosmetics)As mentioned above - the mic-spammers, etc.Trading or buying items is basically essential if you do not want to be called a noob or terrible.Quite a bit of the community I have are not the most kind people to new, unexperienced players.People seem to enjoy exploiting bugs/glitches.Too many people rage.They are essentially turning the game into a free-to-play crappy version of CS:GO.More cosmetics to have to not be considered a noob with the Gun Mettle update.On top of all those, there is the annoying ""don\'t kill me I am a X"" or ""don\'t kill me because I am doing X"" Then there is the abundance of fake youtubers and try-hards who ruin everything for everyone.It was fun for a while, but now it seems like a chore to play.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted January 10, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '304930', 'helpful': '1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'Framerate halved when I looked at a barrel.10/10 would framerate again.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 10, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '232090', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'In short: This game is Killing Floor, but better.Pros:-Great Graphics-Well Done Combat-Fun Gory Gameplay-Plenty of Servers-Server Browser-Open and Well Designed MapsCons:-Matchmaking Sucks (I have only been put into a game with more than one other person once)-Limited Maps (More will be coming though)'}]",-0.9655

I can almost guarantee, my wireless mouse battery had taken a major hit since SoM. The re spawn rate of the Uruks and their captains is phenomenal.There was a city which i literally cleared out, only to witness before I exited 50% of the Uruks have resurfaced, on the way out of the city, more seem to be re-spawning and heading towards the city. There is no break, no relief, it\'s constant mouse-bashing with hardly any skill requirement. I understand we\'re in Mordar, but the gameplay was just stupid as you just spent the entire play mouse bashing Uruks.Mouse Movement was another failure, im not sure how this panned out on Consoles, but you can increase your sensitivity to 10000 and still get areas of movement where you need a 10ft mouse pad to cater, while other movement seemed to confirm the (hypothetical) 10000 sensor settingVarious ""Power ups"" were useless, one was that you can viciously stab an Uruk with a dagger causing the fleet to flee in terror. I attempted this in various scenarios only the group took one step back, then proceeded to attack as normal.This game had great potential, but also had many flaws which basically dragged it into the abyss of the avid gamer, 6/10 for me.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 13, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '8870', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'great game'}]",-0.9136

Ainda sentimos algum lag, porém, é só algumas travadinhas e também não tem o delay que o agar.io tem.Outro aspecto em que, na minha opinião, o mitos.is ganha do agar.io é que ele tem uma boa trilha sonora, que o agar.io nem tem.O mitos.is tem um sistema bom de lvl e dinheiro, que nos possibilita a comprar novas skins e melhorar nossa célula, dando a ela vários benefícios bacanas, como mais velocidade, área de split maior, etc.Porém, em alguns aspectos o mitos.is poderia melhorar. Não sei se isso acontece só comigo, mas, quando tento mudar de modo de jogo, a tela de loading fica carregando infinitamente e, quando tento reiniciar o jogo, ele continua carregando infinitamente e não consigo jogar. Também há alguns momentos no server que há um pouco de lag, que os desenvolvedores poderiam dar uma melhoradinha né ?Minha opinião final: Mitos.is é uma cópia de agar.io melhorada, que tem alguns bugs, porém, acho que ainda tem muito que melhorar.

The story, writing and gameplay from the original game are back, with some new cast members to either be eaten or saved. That's about as good as it gets, however, because (especially in the second half of the game) the developers seem to have forgotten what made the first one so good.The game is as brutal as the first, but without purpose. In the first one, characters died as a result of your failure to protect them. In this one, people die because the developers said so, and because they want to show how 'dramatic' they can be, forgetting that the key point of drama is audience involvement.The game allows you to brood for ages about whether to reconnect with your old friends, or what to do when your plans fail, and then it'll pull out of nowhere a choice that you can't possibly be prepared for. I remember one particular section in which you have to help one of two endangered allies, but both choices led to the same outcome!I don't want to say that it's all bad.

Everything, from the quotes spouted by enemies, to the intentionally cliche dialogue, makes you feel as if you got into a bad acid trip and woke up on the set of Predator.

The game has you roam around as \'Abe\' who is attempting to save his fellow race known as the Mudokens from slavary through the use of voice guiding e.g. ""follow me"" or ""wait here"". In order to navigate through the games hostile areas, you must use a combination of puzzle solving and quick reflexes as your character can die very quickly and can only attack through the use of the enviromoment, hypnotising enemies or using grenades and the shrykull ability, and all cannot be used with ease, for example, you can only hypnotise one type of enemy known as sligs and only if there is no sercurity drone preventing you from doing so. as for grenades and the shrykull abiliy you rarely obtain these through out the game and the grenades can only really be used when you are undetected. all these factors give you a unique and challenging experience that most will enjoy.The game also features plenty of secret areas which you need to find if you want 100% completion.When it comes to changes between the original and the remake aside from the graphics and the smooth sidescrolling as appose to screen by screen scrolling of the original, you wont find many differences between the two. most areas remain the same as far as I can tell with a few minor changes here and there that dont make any difference to how you solve each segment of the game. The game does add a quick save feature which you obviously dont have to use if you want the game to be as close to the original as possible. there is also a difficulty selection which changes how much damage you can take but before you panic, hard difficulty does replicate the original games one shot and your dead level of difficulty. The game also features a new voice command ""all of ya"" which simply allows the commanding of multiple mudokens at onceThere arn\'t really any flaws with the game other than fellow mudokens being difficult to command correctly sometimes and the AI acting weirdly at times.If you\'re looking for a game that offers unique and challenging gameplay then I recommend this game to you.'}]",-0.8863

OMG, it\'s one of the most exciting zombie video games of all time!!!No More Room In Hell was a multiplayer-based Half Life 2 mod that was released in 2011 which has been in development nearly 7 years. The game has been released on Steam in 2013 as a full game, and that means Steam users don\'t need Half Life 2 to play the game.The game has two modes, an objective-based mode and a survival mode, The objective-based is a simple point to point level which needs players to fight hordes of zombies in their way while they\'re going to the main objective, while the survival mode puts players in a scenario which players have to survive and kill some waves of hungry zombies.There are three types of zombies : normal, flesh-eating, Romero-type ""Walker"" zombies, running zombies, and children zombies.You can also have the ability to play the game in single player mode (just go to the create server menu with no other players and just dive in into the game).The game\'s tense and dark atmosphere made the game\'s very fun and scary to explore, especially if you wander alone like a lost explorer. Most maps are pretty dark so you need flashlight to explore the game\'s levels (you can also use a lighter, but it can only lights a bit of an area).Weapons in this game are pretty badass. From pistols to SMGs, knives to machetes, baseball bats to sledgehammers, and semi-automatic rifles to shotguns. The game also have some types of ammo, which firearms with a same ammo type can be used. However, there are still some flaws in this game, which sometimes made the experience a little bit boring and annoying. One of \'em is the stiff, wooden, and unrealistic character animations, the lack of body deformation features on zombies, the lack of allied bot support on single player mode, and the depiction of children zombies. There are also no extra game modes other than the objective and survival modes, and the fact that the game didn\'t have some character and weapons customization features.Still, it is one of the most exciting and scariest zombie survival video games of all time!!!

Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won\'t lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren\'t that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a ♥♥♥♥ ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it\'s time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has ♥♥♥♥ internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn\'t affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I\'ve lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you\'re lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer\'s chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, ""Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree."" So I go behind \'This tree\' and crouch and he walks past me. ""Yeh I\'m all good."" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn\'t move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn\'t see me. Although he didn\'t see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn\'t going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn\'t the only object I\'ve gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I\'ve played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I\'m talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn\'t even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven\'t even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn\'t really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn\'t give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 7, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '252490', 'helpful': '1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""Very Annoying.

I dont know.I finally decided to make the axe, and with a relatively fast moving zombie on my tail and around 70 health left, i quickly spammed the keyboard, looking for the magical inventory button, which the game comveniently never told me what it was, i had to look in the controls menu before i found out it was defaulted to 'Tab', of course.I finally made my axe, 'Now i can kill those rotting, jerkily moving zombies!' i thought to myself, and i started to swing at the zombie who followed me, and after about 10 swings he finally hit the floor.Then, a nurse zombie hit me 3 times and i died, and while the screen went black, i could hear nothing but the very loud screeches of zombies as the game tried to load me into a new area.Luckily, I had set it so i would keep my toolbar upon death, so i didn't lose my half broken axe when i spawned into a desert, however, the game had decided that I was a complete f***ing idiot for dying (you idiot), and had reduced my max health and stamina to 89 points, which i found absolutely ridiculous, way to punish confused players struggling with lag.So anyway, I set out into the desert, and stumbled upon a lone zombie, who i tried to kill.Again, after 12 or so swings he finally fell to the ground, and there was me, bleeding out on 27hp after maybe 2 hits from him.I encountered another zombie by itself and tried to kill it, and died in one hit.Spawned in again, and the game must really think i'm incompetent because it graciously provided me with 79hp this time instead. After exploring a bit I found an abandoned town, and tried to set up camp in a house, the door was broken, so I destroyed it and tried to build a new one, but the game obviously thought i was doing it too correctly, and rotated it so it faced towards the doorframe, and not towards the outside or inside.By that point I had had enough, and I quit.-------------FINAL THOUGHTS---------------Good job, Fun Pimps, you really know how to drop the ball.This game costs around $30, and the awful thing is, it used to cost more.I bought it, and the very day after, they had reduced the price permantely, so that's fun, but I enjoyed it, and i had fun.But then they did something and it made the game awful, like genuinely awful.This game is ugly, badly put together, it is almost unplayable on lowest settings for me, and I can play skyrim with over 200 mods and still have that run smoothly, the game is unfair on the default, normal difficulty and the zombies are jerky, not in a 'this is supposed to look like this' way, they're just badly animated and jerky, you die too quickly and the game takes away from your base health if you die.If I can do anything with this review, it will be to dissuade someone from getting this thing.It's honestly less of a game and more of a money laundering scheme, i mean come on, 2+ years and still in alpha?I'm probably not going to be able to get a refund on this but i'm sure as hell going to try, and if I can stop at least one person from getting this game and making the same mistakes as I did, I will be happy.1/10 - It used to be ok.Good luck and Happy Gaming.-Zanoscar""}]",-0.9986

THIS GAME. You will learn to love it, hate it, despise it and cry over it. Deaths are far too quick to notice where you got shot from. Artillery bombardments make you shake in fear, quiver and panic as you rush frantically to any sort of cover with a roof above your head, only to be blown up mere meters away from safety. Kills are satisfying, requiring patience as a rifleman to ply some of the most awesome kills from afar at unprecedented angles imagined. Have you ever wondered what it's like to shoot at a german stahlhelm slightly sticking out from a trench at over 200 meters from between a broken car's windows? In Red Orchestra 2, you can. When you first start, the game is brutally punishing to you. As a new player, you will die. Treat it like you would treat a boss fight in Dark Souls 2- each death is a learning experience. Soon instead of rushing into a point to secure it, you'll learn to take things slow and have a cautious approach to everything. Cover is essential, but never use the broken cover system. Kills will be far and few in between unless the enemy charges straight on. After putting a few hours into the game, you'll suddenly realize two things: 1. Suddenly, you don't want to be the first to dash between cover. 2. Your aim is steadier under fire. The progression level gives you minimal bonuses that gets better and better the more you play a certain class. For new comers, it is advisable to play as the rifleman class, the most versatile (IMO) class you can choose while not having as much of an impact on a team's potential victory. Get used to bolt action rifles, because those are the most common weapons, but also your most trusthworthy firearm. Of course, the game isn't perfect: Game crashes in between map transitions (for me, at least but I have met a few people suffering from the same issues.) makes for infuriating campaign runs, and rejoining is a pain. Some minor glitches of course (My favourite perhaps was not being able to aim through my M1890 Mosin-Nagant Scope Rifle after dropping from the first floor of a building.) but nothing that detracts from an overall enjoyable (In a slightly masochistic manner) gameplay experience. Well, nothing that can't be solved with a grenade and a suicide.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 21.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '423320', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Ever get bored of promised graphic updates only to be disappointed? Fret not, for Pendragon Rising (And other games from Choice of Games) lets you use your imagination to power their stories. Pendragon Rising is a well written story that urges the reader to quickly come to grasp with the lore of the world, which there is quite a bit to learn on every playthrough. The romance system in the story isn't at all what you've seen in other CoG games, but personally I find it refreshing and a tad bit more relatable. My only complain about the game is how short it can be- it took me roughly 2.5 hours to finish it in my first run, shorter if I hadn't restarted it twice.

This is not your typically shooter.To be honest, Spec Ops: The Line is not a great Third Person Shooter mechanically, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable. It's just simple, in the way any TPS is.It can be frustrating during parts, but if you get past that, it's a great experience. You'll really want to play through this game atleast once for the story. The narrative makes some great statements on games in general, and how they glorify war and violence. It's not perfect, but it's admirable that a developer would take such a risk in storytelling in any case. It's worth supporting this game, at the very least for this.In general, it's a great PC Port, with only minor stuttering at times. Key rebinding is dodgy though. Definitely a console port.""}]",-0.9592

And stealth game fans.I have played this through on hard and I can say the AI is as good as they say, I have had to deal with a lot of bad AI and bad AI is worse when you are in a stealth game. The Alien is random (or “Sudo Random” as programing usually is) it does patrol in different areas but it is not as ridged as the patrols of as say the Hitman games. In one example I decided to follow it so I would know where it was and not bump into it, unfortunately it stopped and decided to turn around and back track = Dead > Reload. I then started to base movement on hiding spots, I rated Lockers as Medium since the alien more often sniffs them out and you lose health while holding your breath, at the top I had well positioned tables with no line of sight to doors, I had a premo spot that was behind a reception desk in a corner, I thought this was safe….Wrong! The alien walked by a few times while waited to time my move to the next room and it decided it hadn’t checked my hiding spot and walked around the desk and peeked under = Dead > Reload.As for the many many bad reviews I have read listing “Plot holes” all I can say is if you have not watched Alien with Directors commentary and seen the cut scenes then you have no idea about the Alien universe and should not be commenting on them. From the start this game has been a homage to the original movie not Aliens or Alien 3, you don’t get the whole picture you are just an average WY Engineer stuck in a mess. Your main priority is getting off the station not figuring out the how and the why, you get snippets of that along the way but mainly you just don’t want to die.Minor Spoiler Alert / Hint (No details but you’ll get some of the plot) Aside from my points above the ambiguity of the alien life cycle in this game can be explained. If you have ever watched any documentaries on Bees and how sister bees are ‘supressed’ chemically it becomes viable for sister bees to start reproducing when not being supressed by a queen, check out this BBC link for more info http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/17854061. Without spoiling the plot too much this game can tie in to the originals and can expand on it without interfering with the trilogy canon. (I do not recognise Resurrection as a movie, I am in denial, it never happened, la la la la.)The game does have some bugs and slightly annoying dynamics, floating revolvers, revolvers that you can’t pick up as it is a scripted event, or the lack of any jumping ability (Oh look small boxes are blocking my path oh well I can’t jump over them). Also painfully slow access to terminals and hacking, I would start a hack only to hear the alien drop from a nearby vent, frantically I’d try to cancel the hack and it would take forever! If I was in that position I would drop what I was doing and F*%$ off quick smart.This game has potential for expansion on an open station theme, I would have liked to see a game mode that started you out on the station before the alien starts killing people, it would have been like a game of last man standing. You & station NPCs are trying to survive as long as possible and you can access all parts of the station with the right tools, said tools can be accessed from the start and not in story stages like the campaign.Overall I think Alien Isolation is an excellent game with a great amount thought put into a classic Alien story line, the environments are polished, characters are very detailed and voiced acted very well. Also even after my first play though I am still hiding under desks and in lockers refusing come out, the game should be called Locker Simulator.'}]",-0.9909

Would you be a ballistic man spewing rockets and mortar non-stop or would you assemble a drone army? This depends on your luck. The spawn items are random which makes the game have a high replay value. Having the right items can make you feel like a god as you see boss after boss fall before you.The music itself is very unique and fits the game very well and I commend Chris Christodoulou for giving the game so much life. The artstyle may be a turn-off for people who do not appreciate 8-bit graphics. However, it appeals to me particularly the Imp Overlord and the monster logs of each creature you can encounter in the game as such a simple art can be so unique.However this game like anything has its drawbacks. After a certain amount of time collecting the right items combination, it is more of a test of patience instead of a test of endurance. At a certain point you would feel your items and your drones are carrying you into the battle instead of you. Some may find the game a little bit brutal particularly during the boss or the late game as they spawn relentlessly but it may appeal to you as it gives you difficulty and challenge.9.99$ for this game? A steal i must say.'}]",-0.3656

In fact, it is the opposite of good, it's a rage game. The only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap.One of the main selling points of this game is the music. Is it good? No, the music is annoyingly repetitive. Although I admit it does sound good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over. Not only that, but there is no other sound at all. Just the sounds of jumping over rocks and trash cans. Also, there are these 'powerup' things that go from Hyper to Mega to Ultra to Extra, and they make the game sound more lively each time. Sounds cool right? Wrong. The music does get more lively until you get to Extra, which turns the music into low, slow sounds that break up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the level. Speaking of levels...The level design, don't even get me started on the level design. First of all, no checkpoints? Really? I get that it is a kind of 'music' (if you could even call this music) game so you wouldn't want the 'song' to be broken up, but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes more than 30 minutes for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 minute level. Who thought this was a good idea? ALso, some of the powerups are in difficult to get places, which is good for a running game like this. The only problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get. One powerup involves you jumping down a hole then springing back up. The problem here is that the spring throws you into a wall, which of course kills you instantly.So, the rating is probably what you want to see from this random guy on the internet.2/10 - Not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 21, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '222900', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'At least they didn\'t release the same game, sell it at full price and add ""Riptide"" on the end.Oh wait..'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 22, 2013.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited July 8, 2014.', 'item_id': '230410', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'You can be a space ninja.'}]",-0.9951

No, Kerbal Space Program is a suprisingly realistic Aside from the stock aerodynamic model, but  that can be fixed [forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com]  space-based flight simulator, centered on the exploration of the Kerbol system. The game, while initaly very challenging for newcomers, is quick to learn, and in a period that can be between several days to several weeks, players will soon be touching down on the Mun (Yes, the spelling is intentional). I have enjoyed many, many hours with Kerbal Space Program, and nevr once have I felt like I made the wrong choice to purchase this game. The games numerous bugs in the physics engine only add to its charm, and will soon have you rolling on the floor. Please, buy this game. Unless you legitamately hate realistic simulations  and worship the broken physics of every space opera ever  you will not be dispointed.'}]",-0.9308

It just trys to be something absolutly huge for the franchise, mixing dramatic storytelling with the rush of Sonic gameplay, and yeah, at the time and on the right hardware, this was revolutionary. Its just plain awful today.The advancements in PC gaming make the attempts for story telling, and the technology used for this effect just laughable. Seriously, the developers of the PC version must have LOW expectations. Your first playthrough of this game (all campaigns) will be memorable for years to come, but not in a good way.  Why?Because this PC port is complete ♥♥♥. Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy's campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.This problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.Why do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad. This effect (and unfortunatly glitch) happens frequently.If you are curious, wait untill it's like $1 in a sale before you buy. Just the hours alone and ONLY the hours alone playing this game would justify that price. If you are on the fence, just don't.Here's hoping Sonic Adventure 2 isn't this broken.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 6, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited April 26, 2015.', 'item_id': '244850', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '>be me browsing reddit>find out that Space Engineers will have paid mods>mod heavy user (roughly 22 mods)>literally♥♥♥♥♥cared.jpg>launch game to remove all mod blocks from over year old save file>""Im Sorry, you are not subscribed to the Mods required to open this world"">imtoolate.png>start crying literal rivers>""To resubscribe to all mods required, press ok"">a glimmer of hope>remove blocks and get email from steam support>""Your credit card declined.

The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today. The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the “other world”. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude. As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York. Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale. Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map. The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various “other world” levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right). The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the “other world”. These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word “PROFILING” fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the “other world”, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred. Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as “Shadows”. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.Continued...""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 29, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '241600', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""What a fantastic game.

Being one of those people, my initial reaction was to pirate this game, expecting something brief not worth my time. Instead, I found a thoroughly enjoyable experience that led me to actually buy the game and play through the levels I had so far completed again.I'll just say it now: I think it's worth buying Besiege for what it currently has to offer. a $7 price tag is insanely cheap for a game that I would expect to cost $15 or $20. While currently there are limited levels available, there really is an infite amount of time one can spend on them. If you simply rush through the game completing each level as fast as possible you'll likely be done in under 2 hours, dependant upon your proficiency.However, you'd be doing the game and yourself a great injustice. This game is not just about completing simple tasks. It's about completing them in the most wacky and roundabout ways you can imagine. You'll find yourself restarting levels to try new ideas, perhaps to beat your time or minimum amount of blocks used, or perhaps just to see if it'll work.Now that I've praised the game, here's what I don't like about it, keeping in mind these will probably all be solved in future updates.1. Lack of tutorialsWhile the game is relatively simple, there are no real tutorials to teach you what to do. If you're clever enough, you'll be able to figure out how to do basic functions by yourself (steering, flying, etc) and the game is all about building, testing, failing, building again. However, some basic tutorials to point players in the right direction could solve a lot of rage-quits.2. No multiplayerCome on developers, this is the obvious thing to do with the game. You add a multiplayer battle arena where you let people fight to the death with their machines, perhaps limiting their number of blocks or which blocks can be used. Maybe you could even add other multiplayer gamemodes, like races or castle sieges. To me this seems like the obvious direction to take the game in, because it'll be awesome and will encourage people to buy rather than pirate.3. The controlsThe controls for moving around the camera seem straightforward, yet somehow I always have trouble adjusting to them. I'm not sure why, everything works the way it should, but I always end up being far too zoomed out when trying to look at something from underneath.4. The lagThis is likely an inherent issue with the engine and not something easily fixable, but I thought it would be worth mentioning. I've got a pretty high end gaming pc, but on levels with a lot of enemies and a very large machine I do find the game to lag momentarily when I test my machine. Keep in mind I've only encountered this in specific scenarios and only for a few seconds before it settles.As you can see, these issues are all relatively minor and will likely be fixed in the future. Even if they weren't, I'd still recommend this game. Buy it.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 23, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '209080', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Guns of Icarus was a very enjoyable experience for my friends and I.

Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It\'s a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC ""Old Gods"". You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.   There are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:   - Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).    - King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title \'King\' is equivalent to the title \'Archduke\' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.    - Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.    - The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).     -The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.    The basic provincial unit of the game is the ""county"". Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he\'ll suffer the ""wrong holding type"" penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.Realm LawsThere are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player\'s inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father\'s dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother\'s lineage.   Gender Laws are the following: Agnatic – Only males inheirt Agnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs. Absolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)However, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.   Inheritance Laws are: Gavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession. Feudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles. This type gives an opinion boost to vassals, but it might have an heir not from the players dynasty—therefore ending the game. Seniority – the oldest dynasty member inherits all titles. The disadvantage is that it usually results in elder characters inheriting, potentially creating a quick succession of short-lived rulerships. Primogeniture – the firstborn child inherits all titles, in depth-first search descent. Arguably the most advantageous inheritance type, but it incurs in a slight prestige penalty for landless progeny. Agnatic Open/Turkish Succession – available to every Muslim character (and also the only type of succession available) – the son that holds most titles inherits all his father\'s titles. Patrician Elective (With The Republic DLC) – the only succession type for Merchant Republics – the heir is decided upon by a calculation of age, prestige, and a unique campaign fund feature from the 5 patrician families. Only males can inherit. Investiture - only succesion law for bishoprics where the successor can be appointent by the ruler if under Free Investiture or by the Pope if under Papal Investiture. If there is no appointed heir then the game will chose character from the court of the bishop or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the bishops court. Elective Open – the only succession type for Republics (and also some types of holdings under the player level) – the game will chose a character from the republic rulers court or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the mayors court. Tanistry – open to Celtic Culture group which, like the Elective system allows vassals to choose the heir but restricts the choice to members of the current holders dynasty. Ultimogeniture – the default succession type for Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the barony of Altenburg, in which the youngest child of the ruler inherits all the rulers titles upon their death. Appointment - Used by Holy Orders feudal vassals called Commanders. All feudal titles are granted by the Grandmaster and revert back to him after the holder dies. Papal Succession - Pope\'s succesion law where elected Cardinal\'s chose the next Pope among themselves. Only used by the Pope if the player owns the Sons of Abraham DLC. King and Emperor-level characters also have a special set of available laws, the ""Crown Authority Laws"", which simulate the power exerted by the monarch over his vassals. For example, with ""autonomous vassals law"", the monarch cannot revoke vassal\'s titles, and they only provide levies to their liege if they hold him or her in high regard. In ""absolute crown authority law"", the vassals are entirely forbidden of waging war against each other and foreign enemies and must provide a sizable amount of levies.That\'s a really really good game for about 1894172381274109487128409 hours of gameplay.'}]",-0.1753

Gameplay breaks down into two buttons; left mouse (or arrow) and right mouse (or arrow), even though it is so simplistic, the execution is perfect. All you are doing is killing Nazi's with your fists but it gets more complex as you play for example, the most common enemy is a Nazi wearing a gas mask, they die in one hit so they are easy to kill. Next up is a Nazi with blonde hair, they take two hits instead of one. After that you have Nazi women - and once they are in the mix, ♥♥♥♥ goes down - they take three hits to kill but, once you hit them they quickly teleport behind you meaning if you hit them from the right, they end up on your left ready to attack so, you must react quickly to hit them again by switching sides but, like I said before, they take three hits so, they will end up behind you again. After the women comes the Nazi Robots. They take four hits but, if you are not quick to destroy them, they will jump back and gang up with other enemies. There is no other strategy against them except to kill them as quickly as possible. The last enemy I have encountered is a Red Ninja and he is special because he is a robot and a woman combined meaning when you hit him, he will teleport behind you and on the second hit, he will jump back and gang up with other enemies.  The Red Ninja takes five hits and he kills me everytime I face him. In order to make this game more challenging, the developers added a health system for you, you have three hit points and no way to regenerate them (at least not from what I have seen). The entire point of this game is to get the highest score possible and it is a challenge to even get onto the leaderboard.

Most games will give paying players some kind of advantage, but not this one. All paid objects will merely be cosmetic or availible to other players through the free drop system. The requirements are easy enough, as my own laptop can run this well. The fan work here is truely staggering. They are making weapons, levels, hats... but mostly hats. Always with the damn hats. The game comes with offline training modes against bots of varying skill, play those before going anywhere near the online segment. If you're the kind of guy who likes to sit at a screen waiting for the next mineral shipment in EVE, the trading community will fit right in, with an ever fluctuating stock market based on, you guessed it, hats! A bit of warning though: the fanbase has a mortal hatred for people who haven't paid yet. Get around this buy buying a huntsman or similar for about fifty cents, less if there's a sale on. Also, never wear the Ghastly Gibus. It's easy to get, but don't be fooled. It is commonly accepted as the sign of the dreaded F2Per. It also makes you head a target. There are lots of weapons and headgear availible, ranging into the hundreds or even thousands. No weapon has an advantage over the other. You may be attracted to the one with higher damage, but there will always be a downside to them. Come on in, new players! We'll find a spot for you lot.""}]",-0.2918

Objective of the game is very straightforward, its the interplay between the 9 playable characters/classes is what makes the game interesting. All of the characters/classes have different unique weapons that players are able to have an advantage over the opponent.The core game has remained constant over the years but there have been notable changes such as new weapons/accessories . Most of this weapons can be unlocked by playing the game, while others must be purchased with actual money. Most of the items that are on the shop can cost less then a dollar to bundles that costs hundreds, there are many ways to customize your experience.There are many items that the player can buy. You can buy hats, shirts, shoes, and other cosmetic gear to dress up in your own special way. Other weapons can have an impact within the game which you can change to suit your play style in game, different classes have different weapons which may or may not be effective in killing certain classes, Then there is loadouts in all of the classes you can have different combinations of weapons, cosmetics and taunts which makes a player unique.In my experience, Team Fortress 2 is by far the most fun free-to-play fps  game which has unique weapons and customization that allows the player to run wild with loadouts.

And most of that has come solely from the level editor.The editor is really fun to play around with, helicopter raids, tank missions, HALO jumps, patrols, ambushes, you name it, you can more than likely do it.The only real problem you might encounter with this game is its difficulty. There is a pretty steep learning curve to get used to it. Theres no second lives, theres no attack dog bonuses. It is probably as close as you'll ever get to war.I wouldn't recommend this to any looking for a quick, CoD style deathmatch. ArmA II's combat takes patience, practice and more patience.

I didn't know what to do with myself when I first played this. It should be explaining as you go what to do and how to do it. Instead it gives you the option to pause the game and watch some 20 minute videos on the Steam forums. That is so stupid. Just explain to me what to do when I'm playing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing.- There is really nothing to do. You can build massive ships and some pretty cool stuff but what after that? Just fly around aimlessly. - The controls are so bad it isnt funny. You press T to interact with objects, to press buttons, get in ships etc, why?T is all the over the other side of the keyboard why would they make one of the most used actions in the game in such an awkward spot. There is 2 jump buttons for some reason, space and F. Why did F have to be a jump button? Why not get rid of that stupid T and replace it with F, and just leave space to jump?And guess what, you can't change the controls.- When flying ships, up is up and down is down. This takes a while to get used to, especially when you've played alot of other flight simulators, where up is down and down is up. To make it even worse, theres no invert look option solely for ships. You can either have it on or off, meaning looking will be inverted when you're on foot to.- Everything is so slippery. You have a jetpack, and its so awkward to manouver yourself. Moving forward makes you tip to the side and flip upside down, while the camera gets stuck and you cant see what youre doing!- The ships arent very clear on how to operate them / interact with them. You see a massive yellow circle sort of thing attached to the bottom of it, so it only makes sense to try and enter the ship that way. No, you have to go over to the dull grey cockpit with no obvious markings to show you enter there.And that concludes my review. Its boring, no tutorial and the most pathetic controls I've ever seen.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 20, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '252330', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""The game is just....bah.One of my major problems with this game is the fact that you walk sooooo slowly.

What were they thinking.Who shakes that much when you are walking so slowly anyway?The game is pretty scary, but Slenderman doesn't really jump out at you much, he sort of just watches you.

Despite how good this game looks, it is surprisingly linear: your making a decision, be it good or evil - kill Sally Lou, or leave her be - has no meaning: for if you decide to go for the Good option, someone else in the group will do whatever they need to do to make sure that the Bad option is undergone shortly before chastising you for being a ♥♥♥♥♥-less ♥♥♥♥ - or on the other end, where you\'ll choose the evil option, the exact same person from scenario 1 will chastise you for being a pussly-less, murdering ♥♥♥♥.The game tries to sell itself by facading as a ""Choose your own Adventure Game"", when what\'s really offered is more along the lines of ""Choose what you want to say to (x) to make them feel gooey inside, or tell them that you don\'t like them as a person, but offer them a lolipop so they feel all gooey inside about being hated by the One Black-Man to survive the apocalypse.Ultimately, this game lies to your face: it hints that it has tonnes of replay value, when in reality, it does nothing to draw you into the game after buying it - you\'d get a better service for your dollar by hiring a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and asking her to hug you for half of her purchased hour, and asking her to leave shortly thereafter.If this review seems long, then that is because I\'m an angry Australian ♥♥♥♥ who can\'t quite be ♥♥♥♥ed to reread his writing, but just isn\'t lazy enough to leave this game review-less.Overall score: 3/10 - would bang again.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 10, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '4000', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'Honestly an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game unless you can wait for it to work.

Though majority of the time you\'re going to have to restart the game to use them if they were downloaded mid-game - but don\'t get me wrong. They are pretty good. What you\'re going to find with the game itself, is that opening a map is going to take anywhere from 2-30 minutes - though you (The reader, don\'t get technical with me about this - I\'ll cut you -) may not experience this. This game is also prone to multiple crashes while playing, this can be anything from a minor annoyance, to a complete game-boner-killer. These crashes are NOT one-off occurances though, they are actually rather common. If you are like... well, any one else, then you\'ll sit back, maybe twiddle your thumbs for a while, and wait in complete, awe-inspiring boredom as NOTHING happens, all in the vein hope that maybe, ""It\'s different this time, it won\'t crash!"" though, just like New Vegas, the game is going to laugh as you sit there, like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot waiting for some miracle that will make your game work.But hey, that\'s just MY experience.

In my opinion this Early Access game realease  is comparable to the release of ""The War Z"" Or ""infestation: survivor stories"" as it was renamed.The developers of both these games should have thought long and hard before releasing such a sh*tty unfinished game onto steam, and valve themselves should be ashamed to have this in their library.To sum up this review, You should SERIOUSLY do some solid research before purchasing this. At the time i purchased it you could not even save the game, which was not clearly stated ANYWHERE on the store page and was clearly a gigantic flaw. I realise this has now been adressed and in future perhaps the many flaws in this game will be, however in its current state it is unplayable unless all you wish to do is slash mutants appart and build trophies out of there body parts, or atttempt to go swimming and end up flying above the entire map (Because F*ck logic).

You can destroy their system by targeting your weapon at the system room to cripple them and generally make your life easier...although they CAN do that to you as well.'}]",-0.9557

This makes 1v1 beacon battles in a Long Range Frigate (sniper) almost impossible.some modules a way OP others totaly underpowered (eg the reload time on Gunship modules removing negative effects is way too long while other ships can pretty much immediately debuff your ship again)Gunships are also too slow in my opinion, while any interceptor can juggle any other ship with ease if a pilot knows what he is doing, making them sometimes impossible to hit.Also there is not a very good Help section in the game and the online Wiki is incomplete (not to mention half russian)This game has a crapton of content though, many different modi and a great gameplay.

Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the ""passive"" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you\'re one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it\'s so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn\'t have.

Agarre todo lo que pude del avión y encontré un campamento, de lejos parecía que no había nadie pero cuando me acerque, habían un montón de cuerpos mutilados y quemados, camine hacia la costa y encontré otro campamento pero esta vez había un indio muerto. Leí mi guía de supervivencia y me las arregle para construir un refugio y una fogata.Día 2 - Me desperté y explore la zona un rato, encontré un palo que me sirvió para pescar. Decidí quedarme en la costa ya que tenía comida y el bosque me asustaba un poco de noche. Empecé a construir murallas de madera. Cuando estaba talando un árbol un grupo de indios se acercó, intente mantenerme lo más alejado de ellos y un rato después se fueron.Día 3 - Seguí talando árboles para las murallas, cuando otra vez se acercaron los indios. Esta vez eran más y uno de ellos me empezó a correr, corrí hacia una colina y ellos regresaron de donde vinieron.Día 4 - Termine de construir las murallas, me fui a explorar un poco el bosque pero de la nada salieron los indios otra vez, intente atacarlos pero ellos me ganaron, Me dejaron inconsciente.Día 5 - Desperté en una cueva. Estaba todo oscuro, prendí mi encendedor y empecé a caminar. Tenía miedo, a medida que avanzo empiezo a ver cabezas mutiladas en el piso, cada vez más y más, algo me ataca por la espalda, corrí por el camino sin mirar atrás, no tenía energía .Me dan el último golpe.Fin del ""diario""Este juego es increíble y eso que está en desarrollo ( Y QUE LO HICIERON 4 PERSONAS!)  - Gráficos: muy buenos. El agua, las sombras (hay uno o dos bugs con las sombras) La luz, las texturas, todo se ve bien eso si hay que arreglar un poco la introducción y los arboles cuando los talas.- Jugabilidad: muy buena, todo depende de vos, no hay tutorial solo 3 hojas de un libro que te dicen cómo hacer un fuego un refugio y como distinguir entre una baya venenosa y una normal. Tú ingenio sirve de mucho podes hacer molotov, hachas caseras, tenes que aprender todo por tu cuenta. Sobrevivir es la clave.- Controles: NO te los dice, ni en opciones ni en el librito, en un sentido me gusta porque tenes que aprenderlos vos pero en otro molesta porque si no le agarras la mano y queres saber algo o cambiarlos no podes.- Sonido: Muy buenos efectos, de noche se escuchan hojas crujir lo que le da un ambiente de miedo, no hay delay excepto en la introducción ahí hay que arreglar mucho, como poner pasajeros en el avión (vas vos solo  tu hijo) el ruido cuando se rompe, y la caída tiene que sonar más fuerte.Mi puntaje: No puedo puntuar este juego ya que esta en desarrollo pero lo recomiendo para la gente que quiere algo nuevo, interesante y divertido. De un segundo a otro podes pasar de cortar árboles a estar rodeado de cuerpos mutilados, este juego da miedo al principio pero cuando conoces a los enemigos y que puede pasar ya no da tanto miedo, lo bueno es que el miedo es constante por que no sabes que puede pasar.

Now, when I finished it, I felt amazing, and this game makes you feel amazing, both with its story (which I won't spoil) and gameplay. But, I finished it in 14 hours, which I didn't have that much a problem with exept for the fact that I finished dust:an elysian tale the day before in also 14 hours, and that was made by 1 person, which got me thinking, thinking about why there's such a similarity between game completion rate and such a big difference between development. However, this greatly redeemed itself when at the end of the credits it said that I completed 2% of it's entirety. Now, the gameplay is very good, from perfect platforming (alliteration!) to a well made third-person shooter, this game trully makes you feel like a badass and at times a genius when you finish a puzzle from a tomb. The only problem I had with the gameplay was the QTEs (quick time events) which got repetitive at times and made me die too many times. Another problem I had was the community for the multiplayer, the problem? It didn't exist, no-one plays multiplayer so I cant really talk about it much. to conclude, Tomb Raider is an amazing single player game with the problem of annoying QTEs and a non-existant multiplayer community, I recommend it for the single player, not the multiplayer.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 20, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '227680', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'I weep for all the people who were mislead in trailers. of all the games people could have gotten on steam, they were unlucky enough to buy this trainwreck, don not buy at all costs!'}]",-0.6975

The leader Corey English Baggins, the shorted leader of them all, he declared war on the Ewoks for the battle of Middle Earth. There I was, in the trenches of the Shire, me, myself, and my rifle sat there as we saw our fellow tiny comrades get gunned down by the MLG Ewoks. As I sat there and looked at my AK, I looked at my magazine, which was almost empty, I decided to take my last breath as I climbed up the trench towards the enemy. Before my eyes, an army of Ewoks were lurking toward my position so I decided to turn on my MLG sniping skills, I gunned the first squadron of Ewoks. As I look down my iron sights to shoot the next enemy approaching me, I got capped by an enemy parachuting from a bi-plane.I was on the ground bleeding out, thinking of my last memories of my loved ones. It was my time to go. Then appeared a great white bearded figure falling at the speed of light. He pulled two AK’s out of his cloak, and impaled the ground, leaving a crater so big that the enemy was almost wiped out completely. I couldn’t believe my eyes, it was our lord and savior, our profit, Gandalf the White. Gandalf swung his weapons of mass destruction and nut-shot every one of those little furry buggers. One by one, I heard the most glorious sound ringing in my ears, furry nuts exploding and bodies falling to the ground. Gandalf the White slowly lurked towards me and put out his hand and said, “I can see clearly now the Ewoks are dead, they are all dead and blown apart” The first wave of Ewoks were defeated, and that was just the beginning.Ten hours later, Gandalf the White was holding my hand in the hospital bed, stroking my arm. “It’s all ogre now son, it’s all ogre.” Legg the magnificent was watching through the observation window outside the hospital room. 10/10 –IGNThe New York Times- Best story ever, I was fully immersed in the story and got tears at the end!

I really enjoyed both series and have grown to love Killing Floors new take on gameplay such as the removal of Crosshairs and the lack of endless waves like CoD Zombies. The game has 7 classes. Demolitions, Sharpshooter, Commando, Firebug, Field Medic, Support Specialist, and Bezerker. Each class takes a while to level up (A while meaning that it could take a month grinding out a class to the max level of 6.) so if you're a completionist then you can take the time to grind out your classes if thats your thing. The achievement hunters will have a couple hundred achievements to get. Some like the Hell on Earth achievements (Max difficulty achievements) can take a very long time to get due to how difficulty Hell on Earth can be. Simply put, Killing Floor might have a dead playerbase, but if you gather up some friends there's lots of fun to be had.Also.LODESAMONE.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 7, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '550', 'helpful': '3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'This is a soley teamwork related game with many gamemods to choose from and an AI Director that keeps making random experences everytime and special infected that require a team to fend off this game couldn\'t get any better I could explain in detail all the gamemods but here are the basicsCampaign- This gamemode pits you against AI hordes and special infected with human controlled team mates which requires close teamwork to survive each finale from holding out to collecting gas to even running across a bridge thats being bombed by the militarySingle player- Nothing much to say about this game mode its the normal campaign but instead of humans its offline botsVersus- In Versus you are pitted against swarms of common infected while fending off human controlled specials each team takes turns playing as humans and infected with these playable infected and non playable infected: The Smoker- He will drag survivors with a long tounge towards him and will repeatidly bash them untill their team mates free them or they die if he can not directly drag them to him he will constrict them where they are stuck. The Boomer- Nothing much to explain about him he is a bloated infected who will throw up boomer bile on the survivors attracting a horde to attack them and attractting nearby infected if killed he will explode showering bile on nearby surfaces and survivors their is an item that allows the survivors to use his own bile against him. The Hunter- A hooded teenage looking infected who will leap great distances to catch lone survivors dealling massive damage untill killed or freed can leap from far and high places to deal damage pounces which range around 1 to 25 damage dealling instant damage and is the only infected that does not have to wait for his ability to recharge. The Charger- This infected has a large arm that will smash into survivors knocking other team mates into the air he cannot be bashed off his victim normally having to be killed a Charger may also ram survivors off high places incapping or killing instantly. The Jockey- The Jockey is the only infected that can move their victim around willingly instead of the Chargers ram which cannot be steered as well as the Smokers pull and Hunters pounce The Jockey can be fought against though if the survivor mashs their move buttons making it difficult for the Jockey to move them but they also deal damage much like the others clawing at their victims face untill downed and unable to ride like the Hunter it must pounce to capture someone. The Spitter- Purely a support infected like the Boomer the Spitter can split survivors with her acid spit or can spit on incapped or ""pinned"" survivors spreading panic and killing the survivor quicker making it a valuable asset to the team if used correctly like the Boomer its death has a last act of revenge spreading its acid although smaller on the ground like its spit attack. The Tank- The Tanks the brute force and favorite of most players the Tanks only goal is to spread damage to kill or make a miserable mess of the survivors defences with 3 different attacks like its punch attack which knocks back survivors knocking them senseless for a short amount of time a rock throw attack taking out snipers who aren\'t willing to take any damage from the behemoth and knocking them down giving the Tank a chance to get close and a car/object punch which sends any car or object flying and immediatly incapping survivors or on rare chances stumbling them or killing them making it very effective at taking out close groups and clusters. The Witch- The Witch is one of the only infected thats avoidable only attacking when disturbed killing and incapping in one hit being startled by flashlights and close survivors.Realism and Realism Versus- Realism is a gamemode of pure teamwork being unable to see someone through walls or being pinned also Witches will kill in one hit Realism Versus is purely the same as Versus defualt just with the added rules of Realism.Survival- Much like the Call of Duty gamemode Zombies but with a twist the survivors are able to equip anything they like before they start the match and instead of rounds its random hordes and Tanks as well as a timer recording how long your team survived 2 alteritive Mutations( We will get to these) are Survival Versus which is Survival with Versus merged and one team sets the time while the other beats it and keeps going till one team does not beat the others time and Hold Out which is like a Hold Out finale but quicker to finish.Scavenge- A quick version of Versus one team must collect gas cans and put them in the generator while the infected team must try and stop them from beating their score the first team to beat their score all added together wins the match.Mutations- Weekly gamemodes like Hunting Party, Last Man On Earth and TAAAANK! that are available on the Steam Workshop along with other community made skins and Campaigns that are remixes of gamemodes or entirely new ones as earlier mentioned Survival Versus is one such gamemode.Now for the conclusion this game has its ups and downs like its prequel but its worth buying the glitchier but funner version on P.C with the custom content and free DLC some players do not like the lack of weapons while most like it cause its simple and means your favorite weapons never too far from reach but what about the gamemodes? are some even worth playing? It is true that Survival and Scavenge are not played as much like Mutations mostly cause most players normally have enough time on their hands to play a full Campaign or Versus match and most of the Mutations that are fun require manual installation or having to be found in the wasteland of the Steam Workshop but this does not mean its not a bad game I rate it 9/10 Cause of its teamwork based gameplay which I have yet to see in many games and plus Valves style of simplicity with simple graphics and not overly complicated gameplayer (I am looking at you Battlefield and Call of Duty) this games a hit and miss some people will like it some will not but I absolutely love it as I have played the first since it came out and loved that even though I was missing alot such as weapons and items and lacking infected varity but its simplistic gameplay style contributes to it so thats my review and have a great day!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 17, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218620', 'helpful': '2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'On the brightside.

Currently, I have found no public servers in my time playing the game. This means that when I hit ""Play"" it drops me into the nearest server it can find, which is probably hosting in Russia or something because I get about 5000ms ping. It\'s actually impossible to play sometimes, as in you can\'t move or anything because of this.I can live with there being no players, as long as the game is playable. But, there is no way to host your own server without paying somebody to do so, and I\'ve already wasted enough money on this game.When it is working, so far I have found no food in my ENTIRE PLAY TIME. Meaning I have starved to death WITH EVERY CHARACTER. I have encountered NO PLAYERS. And in fact, on the most recent update of the game I haven\'t even seen and zombies either.Pros:- NoneCons:- No players- No servers (Playing from Aus, this means I get so much ping the game is uplayable)- No local hosting- No zombies (This IS a zombie game, right?)- No supplies- When you do get a gun it\'s just before you\'re about to starve to death, and you\'re more likely to be smitten by god in all his fury than get ammo for it. There isn\'t anything to shoot at either- There is no merit in playing it, you can\'t even try to be the best player on the server because you are literally the only one- It\'s an hours run to get to anywhere (And you won\'t even find anything there most of the time)'}]",-0.992

I have no real way of doing anything to stop them and I can't leave either. the other thing that I noticed was people farming up smurf accounts by getting a bunch of kills and carrying for the first five or six rounds and then turning an auto spin on and going afk.

I was told to destroy some explosives with a pack of C4,I thought, ""Sure no problem, you mean this box over here that clearly has explosives on it?"" *dies* ""... was that not it? let me look around for something else then..."" *10 mins later* ""there is literally nothing else that even remotely resembles explosives, this has to be it..."" *dies* ""am i doing it wrong? am i too close? i\'ll stand further away and put it right on top of it then..."" *dies* ""i can\'t stand any further away!"" at this point i got angry and decided to throw the C4 willynilly all over in the hopes of getting lucky.(announcer guy): ""alright now that that\'s done."" (me) ""i\'m sorry... what? you wanted me to... throw the C4, over this wall, with no indication that the thing i need to blow up is there?""Now i\'m fully aware that i may be an idiot and i just didn\'t hear him say it was there, so i waited for my friend who was playing the tutorial at the same time as me to get to that point, so i could check that it wasn\'t just me... but no, we were given no indication of where to find the thing we were supposed to blow up.Yes i know two reasons isn\'t really enough to judge a game, but i judge a game on playability and how easy it is to learn to play, the tutorial other than that part was sub-par at best and we had instances of random glitching into places we weren\'t supposed to be in, like the railing the instructor stands on, which we had to clip out of.Now take from this review what you will, it\'s my personal experience with the game and my personal feelings towards it, the positive reviews out weigh the negative so maybe i was really unlucky.'}]",-0.7312

Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven't seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don't like the idea of paying for a game that hasn't even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn't every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it's the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn't be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it's like a broken record, and I'm not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy's, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle 'A game to fight inner demons' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an 'inner demon' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I'm sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.So if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn't bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.""}]",-0.9972

Os gráficos podem não ser de ultima geração, mas o que importa é a diversão e isto o jogo consegue fazer e muito! São inúmeras possibilidades que pode se fazer neste jogo, inúmeras táticas, como Stealth mode ou Heavy mode. Outra coisa interessante é as posições de algumas coisas (como cofres) que são mudados aleatoriamente para outro local, assim deixando o gameplay menos monótono. Jogar Offline é um tédio, não vais jogar 1 hora sem enjoar, agora jogar Multiplayer, nossa, é sensacional, divertido de mais! Sabe do que mais é sensacional? Sua dificuldade e sua trilha sonora. Tá lá você andando, inicia um roubo e começa aquela música de ação, você se envolve naquilo de uma maneira inexplicável, isto valendo também para o modo Stealth. Ah e recomendo jogar com amigos e cada um deles seguirem uma classe da árvore de skills (como eu chamo), mas também é legal jogar com uns gringos de vez em quando.******************************************************************************************************Análise geral******************************************************************************************************   7| Gráficos                                                9| Jogabilidade                           10| Diversão                                       8.5| Tempo de jogatina                        9.5| Trilha sonora9.5| Dificuldade******************************************************************************************************Nota final: 9 - Ótimo******************************************************************************************************'}]",-0.9078

The maps are also interesting with your typical treeless miles of crater filled mud where only the quick of feet survive , half destroyed fortresses , trenches with players struggling in close quarter combat with pistols, grenades and bayonets, french farm land where men charge and die for a little more than 100 yards of corn only to reach trench on the other side  Not to mention that one reason I like this game is the use of automatic weapons is ether restricted to realistic levels or having disadvantages such as not being able to fire until deployed or having horrid hip fire accuracy.

It can also be enjoyable, and playing with friends is great too, but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed.

I know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem. That\'s not the only problem, for some reason, i had these HUGE LIGHTS that were apearing out of no where, and almost making me blind. The PC Au servers, are also, terrible (at least there dedicated this time) but still bad, you can one round have the best ping, and then next, awful ping, and my internet isn\'t even that bad (and i have australian internet ahha). The games killing system and aiming could also be improved... *doesn\'t help that im not that good of an aim ahah* but still after playing CS:GO for example, i can be doing well in that, and finding that when i get killed its ""oh okay, fair enough"" and when i get a kill ""well that was good"" in BO3, its like when you get killed ""OMG WHAT THE F*CK, HES HACKING OMG THATS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T"" and when you get a kill ""no way i got that?"" and thats just a few things to name. It\'s also very buggy, and you can tell that it has been rushed, either that or its just a bad console peasent to PC port. I had high hopes for this game, and im not impressed, at all. I did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable, and is most likely keeping me from refunding it, its just MP need\'s to be improved ALOT. Cheers'}]",-0.9575

El resultado sería Kung Fury, un filme lleno de momentos tan absurdos y divertidos que lo hacen un clásico de culto instantáneo… Pero ¿qué sería de una película como esta sin su dotación de gore, violencia y razones inexistentes para tener una explosión en pantalla? No se preocupen, Kung Fury les otorga todo eso y más en la forma más gráfica posible, y al mismo tiempo, hilarante.La película narra la historia de Kung Fury, un tipo malencarado y atractivo al que le ha sido concedido el poder del trueno y el de una cobra para convertirse en Kung Fury… Elegido para derrotar al  mal.En la tradición de Army Of Darkness (1992),  Kung Fury marca un hito dentro de la cultura popular del cine, trayendo de vuelta esos estereotipos clásicos de películas ochenteras que le daban un toque diferente a la acción. Robocop (1987), Terminator (1984) y My Science Project (1985), todas ellas y más están en este medio metraje financiado a través de Kickstarter que incluye una actuación especial de David Hasselhoff.No cabe duda que esta película marca gran diferencia entre las producciones multimillonarias de Hollywood y las realizaciones caseras (que en los últimos tiempos tienden a tener mayor creatividad ya que aprovechan sus recursos al máximo). Kung Fury es un claro ejemplo de ella, la gente se encantó con el cortometraje que presentaba la idea principal y el resto de la historia lo cuenta la película.En sólo media hora David Sandberg, quien dirige y protagoniza esta joya visual que hasta busca tener mejor imagen al acudir al “tracking” de la VHS en la que se esta reproduciendo, nos lleva por un cuento surrealista lleno de colores, saturaciones visuales y un desarrollo espectacular que dejará a muchos con sed de volver a esa manera simple y sencilla, y sobretodo exagerada, de hacer cine.Sin duda, si buscan desconectarse de la maquinaria voraz que es Hollywood, Kung Fury es la respuesta y seguramente dirán que es tan mala que es más que buena.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 21, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '730', 'helpful': '3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Si bien llevo poco tiempo jugando este gran juego sólo puedo decir que Counter-Strike ha destacado tantísimo y sigue siendo tan reconocido, es por ser un juego de habilidad al 100%.

You will never beat the classics such as minecraft, no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore...... but tbh TERRARIA is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!! you think the producers of minecraft have it hard, OF COURSE THEY DO!! its a 3D game, everythings difficult. even tho Terraria is a 2D game it has so much more content including bosses, weapons, biomes, enemies, items, NPC's, tools, ores and A LOT MORE!!! like srrsly you think or minecraft, then think of everything is has. terraria has it but about 5 times more. ESPECIALLY items, terraria has like..... 50 times more items then minecraft. Minecraft just simply cant compete. with terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword, pickaxe and an axe. You find a tree, chop it down, make a house, make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench, some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons, look at wiki or do it yourself. spawn an easy boss and DESTROY!!! it with the AMAZING new weapons you have scavenged and made. collect its drops to save up copper, silver, gold, platnium coins to buy unique items from NPC's such as, awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining. and just when you think its over a meteor lands, you go find its location, (attempt to) mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads, use the meteor armor, weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold. once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons, get better weapons to go aaaallllllll the way down to the underworld (A.K.A HELL!! XD) to mine some hellstone! make a giant pathway thought the underworld, kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll, drop it in lava and summon the WALL OF FLESH with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game.... (killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode) harder enemies, new bosses, destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops, which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine....... ANYWAY i HIGHLY recommend buying this game. HOURS AND HOURS!!!! of fun!! i just.... this game is AMAZING!! please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themWHATEVER you can you NEED this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway!!! :) Take Care ;)""}]",-0.9489

Para olvidar los males de la segunda guerra mundial y males sociales y políticos causados por la misma, y haciendo de sus habitantes personas de hablidades físicas y mentales mucho más amplias.Calificado como un shooter de primera persona, también tiene un toque de aventura y  survival horror; el juego comienza con un accidente de avión en medio del océano antes mencionado, y siendo los únicos sobrevivientes de éste optamos por buscar refugio y ayuda, pasamos a la entrada de lo que parecer ser un faro, pero al meternos descrubrimos una ésfera (batisferas es el nombre correcto) que nos dirige hacia la ""Atlántida moderna"", pero ya no es lo que parece o lo que se suponía debía de ser... Donde ahora hay: ""Vías de agua. Lunáticos. Rebelión y ahora puñeteros fantasmas. ¿No es genial vivir en Rapture?""Hay sólo una decisión importante en el juego, cosechar o salvar a las pequeñas. Si eres alguien puro y de corazón de oro, ya sabes qué hacer. y si eres de esos diablos que quieren demasiado pode, no digamos más y comienza a cosechar, pero cada acción tiene sus consecuencias, aunque ellas siempre se mantendrán fieles, pero el final feliz y verdadero es siempre el de ayudar a los demás.Sus pros, son la música que sencillamente es maravillosa, la animación aunque sea un juego del año 2007 es adecuada a su época, el juego te mete tensión por la atmósfera obscura y gracias a esto puedo probar que el argumento de que es un survival horror es cierto; el control de las armas es bueno y lo que se puede hacer con los plásmidos es fenomenal, de la misma manera puedes tener ""aliados"" como torretas, cámaras de seguridad y robots guardias que puedes hackear para lo mismo, también puedes comprar munición que es algo sumamente bueno, puesto que si no la encuentras en el cádaver de un enemigo, lo puedes comprar. y tenemos el uso de EVE que sustituiría a lo que vendría siendo la magía. Lo malo es, el final... Podría decir que es lo único malo, aunque muchos se quejan de que hay créditos después del final, a mí me hubiera gustado verlos, y aparte de que, aunque sea el verdadero o el malo, es un tanto corto, interesante pero corto; y muchos otros valores que no se explotan dentro del juego.Al final, ¿qué distingue a un hombre libre de un esclavo? ¿Dinero? ¿Poder?

Tiene sus momentos trágicos pues te vas a separando de tus compañeros (al inicio) y tienes que ir buscando a los demás a lo largo de tu recorrido por la ciudad de Seattle.Lo maravilloso de Deadlight es que nos hace sentir en un mundo caótico con la siempre necesidad de huir, aunque no es todo correr a la derecha o izquierda, puedes hacer ""parkour"" y de plano te encuentras con 2 o 3 armas a lo largo del juego. Requiere un poco de estrategía eso sí, trata bien de medir tus actos antes de hacer una acción, pues todo conlleva a otra, hay zombis por donde te lo imagines y si no eres precavido pueden agarrarte unos 4 o 5 y ya, valiste y a empezar desde el último Checkpoint. Las situaciones en las que se encuentra en protagonista, mediante avances, serán cada vez más complejas. De igual manera, si huyes sin mirar atrás creyendo que te has salvado de todo, no es así; ya que si quieres tener todos los logros (todos, todos) deberás encontrar ciertos objetos secreto que podrías estar dejando el mismo momento que trata de echarte a fuga.Composición de la Banda sonora, ¡fabulosa!, con sus toques triste y pseudo eufóricos en los momentos menos esperados, algo que tal vez no remarqué y debería hacerlo es la animación de la cinemática...

Al agregar un modo cooperativo para dos usuarios (a través de internet o a pantalla dividida en consolas) es la incorporación más notable y llamativa, no obstante ésta no debe distraernos del hecho de que hay muchas novedades más y también de enorme importancia, la naracción, incluisición de nuevo personajes y resolución de puzzles y la hablidad de pensar al tener que pasar una cámara de pruebas o completar logros, lo cual es bueno, ya que no es tanta la variedad de juegos que tengas rompecabezas en él, y más aparte la gran minoría los compra. Portal 2 comienza de forma espectacular. Al inicio descubriremos que nada es lo que parece, y que lo que en los instantes de apertura parece ser una aventura en la que caminaremos solos, rápidamente recibe (un golpe de suerte, literal) inesperados aliados y viejos conocidos como los enemigos.La simpatía del juego se gana debido a que los diálogos que nos dan son doblados al español y con toques humorísticos bastante agradables, el doblaje del juego es bastante bueno a mí parecer, encaja perfectamente con los personajes.Recuerda buscar objetos ocultos al finalizar las cámaras pues puede que sirvan después para ayudarte a conseguir un logro, y con el ya mencionado modo cooperativo tienes un sinfín de diversión con amigos y siendo muy estrategico mediante ello.Para terminar, y dejarme de rodeos, un juego que no te puedes perder y es necesaria su compra, créeme...

La temática acerca de una guerra nuclear que ha dejado un mundo post-apocalíptico en donde algunos de los habitantes, -de lo que antes se conocía como Rusia- del Metro viven como personales normales en sus hogares, apesar de las pesadillas vivientes en la superficie.  Hasta que una amenaza conocida como los ""Oscuros"" acecha a tu estación-hogar. Allí es donde tú, el protagonista debes intervenir, para salvar lo que queda de tu ya deteriorada morada.El juego en sí cuenta con unas gráficas buenas, para su año de estreno y también lo mismo en cuanto a la versión ""Redux"" se refiere, la música, y ese ambiente que hace querer ver bien por donde andas, pues puede estar oliendo tu miedo las criaturas de las tierras altas, la hace un shooter y survival horror imposible de perder. La variedad de armas que encontrarás será fantástica, desde una simple revolver hasta un potente lanzallamas. La opción de ayudar o no a personas que, a lo largo del juego, necesitarán una bala o un pequeño favor tras ayudarte a avanzar en tu camino hacía la ciudad de Polis, pero no creas que no te dan nada por eso, los puntos morales sirven para acumular un secretito. Inclusive, dos finales diferentes, que dependen de si has cumplido con el antes mencionado sistema moral podrás ver el lado bueno de las personas que, en un principio, creías hóstiles.¿Vale la pena comprarse el juego? Creo que de lo poco que he dicho debe ser buena razón para comprarlo. Estoy seguro que lo disfrutarás, tiene logros que seguro te harán pasar un rato o que tal vez cumplas a la mitad de la historia. Algunos cuestan trabajo, pero puedes repetir capítulos para completarlos todos. Puede ser que tenga sus dificultades como unos cuantos bugs que me encontré en la misión ""Chocera"", y a veces puede crashearse, pero creo que no tendrás problemas si por lo menos lo juegas en una PC de escritorio, pero si tienes una computadora gamer y deseas entretenerte por lo máximo unas... 25 horas (más lo acumulado con los logros) o 30 horas, es un juego que te va a dejar encantado, sobretodo con los mensajes que dejan algunos personajes como ""Khan""Reitero, no puedes perderte este juego traído de la mano de la novela ""Metro 2033"" de Dmitry Glukhovsky y el equipo de 4A Games.

En sí, el juego narra una gran historia con personajes variados y con un buen tono de color (hasta se ponen azules de la asfixia, literalmente), tiene un buenísimo guión, es muy extenso y elaborado de tal manera que hace no parezca de relleno cierta situación, de modo que, al final todo encaja perfectamente.

The graphics are abysmal; actually worse, by far, than graphics in games 10 years ago. To put that in context, this year we will celebrate Half Life 2's 10th anniversary. Maybe I just have slow internet (thanks Abbott) but seeing other players move around without even an attempt at leg animation is disconcerting.Following on, the servers are slow as all hell. If you do manage in a semi timely fashion to find and log onto a server, assuming the slow response time hasn't basically frozen your mouse, you will be greeted with some of the worst lag you've ever seen. Be forewarned fair traveller, you will think it's a one-off lag problem. Verily it is not. I have never actually tolerated this much lag in a game and it seems to be a pretty standard part of Nether so there's that. This of course makes combat a frantic button mash with little to no skill.At first I thought this might be why I can't seem to move smoothly, but then I realised that the entire world has been put together so half-assedly that physically conected land elements (like a floor and a ramp) might require you to jump over some imaginary partition holding them together. Clipping is, as you can imagine, basically just part of the ambience at this point.Then there's the game itself. It seems to have no idea how games are meant to work. There are safezones where you spawn when you die. In theory, in a safezone you can't use weapons, can't die, and the nether can't get in. This will periodically cease to be true and you have to run around repairing the anti nether devices. As a noob, you will be the ONLY one running around repairing anti-nether devices. Everyone else can survive without them just fine. When you aren't running for your life from aliens, which teleport by the way, utterly ruining the point of a zombie survival game, you're couriering parcels from A to B in the vain hope that you can scrounge enough bits and pieces from these transactions to craft a semi decent weapon. None of this is immediatley obvious to you as the game has basically no explanation of anything at all.Upon undertaking a task outside the safezone, you will rapidly become aware of the fact that the difficulty of the nether around you will in no way be tempered to suit your skill level or armoury leading me on my first run to take on a small nether army which included a golem (try to guess what they're like) with nothing by a can gun (one shot shotgun made from a spray can) and a sword. Needless to say I died.On subsequent attempts I found fewer nether, which was great for me, but alas this came at the price of having other players around me. It turns out that the average nether player is cut from the same cloth as a day Z player, and will galdy follow a n00b out of the safe zone for the explicit purpose of killing them and looting the $10 dollars they have. Fortunately for them, since they tend to already have automatic weapons and heavy body armour, this is an enetertaining and low-risk sport. For those of us trying to figure out the game, it is not.In short, I have yet to find any element in this game which I think is good. You find eclectic items throughout the world, all of which are terribly rendered and usually look like an entire stash of discrete items, much to your chagrin. You sort of have to guess which ones can be combined at the weapon smith and into what. Until then, you're lugging around 50kg of ♥♥♥♥ with no way to use it. Things pop up on the screen which I'm sure are meant to be informative, but mean absolutely nothing if you haven't had it explained before, and when you start out, your chance of survival is approximately 0. Since you spawn with nothing but what you could put into a global stash (I assume, this bit is a bit fuzzy) after dying, it makes it nigh on impossible to ever advance to any reasonable level. Statistically any level of enemy can appear anywhere (except the reapers) and players have trained themselevs to see all non-tribe-members are walking goody-bags/piñatas. The game has a decent idea behind it, and if it were designed by competent designers and hosted on semi-decent servers, with a reasonable how-to guide, and some mechanism giving new players are fair shot, it'd be worth the $15. At this point though, I wouldn't even waste the bandwidth on it if it were free.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 22, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '50300', 'helpful': '1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""By now you're probably aware of the game's gimmick. It's an emotionally punishing morality based knock off of Dark Heart (Apocalypse Now) masquerading as a generic FPS. The game aims to put you into a series of morally conflicting positions. Situations you would likely have faced in many other FPS's but it tries to humanise your opponents and confront you with the ramifications of your actions. Cute. If you want to get a better idea of what the themes are and how they're implemented Extra Credits has two good videos about it on YT (one with, one without spoilers), if you can put up with the pretentious high-morality fapping to the game.So let's look at this one three levels: the morality mechanic, the themes of morality and PTSD from a narrative perspective, and the actual quality of the game play otherwiseThe Morality MechanicThe themes of morality manifest themselves as game mechanics when you periodically come across “moral” situations and have to make a decision about how to proceed. Here's how they've utterly ♥♥♥♥ed it up: * At times, and one scene in particular everyone keeps raving about, you're presented the illusion of choice but no actual choice. You do the one thing the game lets you do, and are treated to what I assume was meant to be an emotional cut-scene to punish you for it. I cannot feel bad for doing the thing the game required. This isn't console players blubbering into their controllers, this is the PC master race. We've been dropping chemical weapons on civilians since Postal. You gotta bring something better than that.* The majority of the time the game misleads you about your options. There are hidden “high morality” alternatives in a lot of cases. Sure it's nice for the game to put explicit and hidden alternatives in, but the thing is you can just play the game the way the game tells you to and it still works fine. There's no reason to look for alternatives. In fact I'd've been more morally invested had I seen the high-morality option and still felt I needed to take the low morality choice.* And finally, and probably most egregiously: the moral choices you make seem so to have absolutely no impact on the game. Why would I make the moral choice here? I'm trying to get from this level to the next one and I will shoot a civilian in the head if that's what the game says I need to do to progress the story. I absolutely loathe ending changes based on a morality meter (à la Bioshock, Dishonored) but if you implement a morality mechanic it needs to at least change the game-play somehow. The entire game seems to assume that everyone who plays a game like BF or CoD must spend their entire time vacillating over how they could solve each problem in a moral way. I, like I think most normal PC gamers, just did what the game said I should do. I'm not interested in the lives of NPC's who don't even get a name tag. I don't care. It's a game, it's a challenge to get from A to B. You need either REALLY good storytelling or something particularly special to make me feel things, or harder still, to make my feelings factor into my game play style. The Narrative ThemesThe terrible implementation into the game-play not withstanding, the artistic value here is pretty high. The story is kind of interesting, despite its obvious plot-holes, the way they represent constant descent, the psychosis colour schemes, loading screen accusations, the 4th wall breaking. They're not all immediately obvious, but they're there and they're pretty well thought out and it'll give you plenty to mull over and wonder about on a second play-through. While we're at it, the general visuals are pretty sweet actually, so good job there.The Actual Game-playI won't say that graphics don't matter, or that narrative doesn't matter, but I will say and I will defend this to the hilt, they matter less than mechanics. A game with a pretty poor delivery can still be good if its mechanics are solid. But the opposite is rarely true. Spec Ops: The Line does not have good mechanics. I mean yes it's so so agonisingly obvious that this is a port from a console game, and it has what are pretty standard mechanics for a console game I guess so fine, but I'm sitting on PC, wondering why I spend half my time hiding behind a bench or wall or ornamental plant pot, taking turns to fire at enemies who are also hiding behind whatever debris magically happened to be there. The most tactical thing in the game is blowing up explosive barrels or taking advantage of the ridiculously contrived breaking-glass-to-unleash-an-avalanche-of-sand mechanic the whole handful of times the game remembered it wanted that to be a thing. A fortunately all the miniguns scattered around shopping centres can be turned around and used to mow down waves of suicidal enemies. Your NPC'sBut the worst, the absolute worst, and this I cannot forgive a game, are your NPC's. In theory you have a sniper and a heavy and you can light up a target for them to take out. Yeah good luck with that. They're useless as all hell, they get in your way a LOT, by the time they eliminate a target for you, you could just have done it yourself since you need to have the reticle on the target anyway to tag them. But to top it off, if they get shot, you need to run in and revive them. And they have no idea of how to not get shot. ♥♥♥♥ stealth, these guys assume that not only are you going to speed-run-n-gun this game, but that you will somehow provide much better cover for them than mere concrete or sandbags ever could, so eschew both in favour of just sitting out in plain sight. Possibly the worst example of NPC's ruining any hope you have of making good tactical choices is one scene where you see a yacht in the desert. Plenty of openings, no aerial cover, and a reasonable amount of open ground between you and it. Open ground which has an inbound truck load of enemies. I wanted to stay put in my indestructible aircraft hull, with a box of nades, a box or ammo, high ground advantage, and crucially, one small controllable entrance. But my highly trained delta force sidekicks thought our only hope for survival would be to run like idiots for the yacht and then stay put half way when I didn't run with them. Needless to say they got mowed down and I lost the game for not reviving them fast enough. If the game had let me I'd've shot them in the first 5 minutes and gone on alone but alas the point of the game seems less about killing the enemies and staying alive than it does basically babysitting two idiots with the survival instincts of a screamapillar through a war zone dodging bullets to shoot them full of adrenalin.Final ThoughtsOver all the idea of the game was fine – put players in a situation where they question their actions despite playing a game, or even question their actions in all games. The problem is it didn't work, must like the “Would you kindly” scene in Bioshock, it didn't work. Because I did what I did because that's how you make game progress. The designers may have tried to go meta and accept that players rage-quitting would just be one of their “endings”, or try to argue that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics are there to fill you with a sense of unease to foreshadow the descent into madness theme, but really, it didn't work. Good idea; implement it better. The visuals were stunning and some of the little bits and pieces of depression were nice (like the slowly decaying soldier in the menu screen) but the core mechanics were ♥♥♥♥, the game-play was highly linear, it was all cover based shooting, the shooting itself was clunky and frustrating, the NPC's are worse than the enemy, and even the storyline needed tidying up. If you're making an FPS, make an FPS; once you've managed to do that well, then we can talk about themes and story. But at the end of the day morality does NOT belong in games. Especially not shooters.

Ideally, a game should be a perfectly good standalone with an online option for later once you've completed everything else and have become bored. This is the opposite. A multiplayer with a single player tacked on as an afterthought. Ignoring the poor graphics and general design reminiscent of Postal 2 and similar games which were never intended to be taken seriously, the design of the AI in this game is appaling. By far the worst I've ever seen. Not only the enemy AI but your own team. No attempt was made to make the team anything more than backup muscle. Team members can't be ordered to hold/attack positions or execute objectives. They follow you around stupidly and shoot at things which happen to stand directly in front of them, not even noticing when they are being repeatedly shot. The enemy AI is similarly stupid not noticing things in plain sight but they have the advantage of clipping through you and your team to get behind you very quickly. So there's that. Not to mention overwhelming force.Granted the game is designed to hold off violent confrontation as long as possible but with the AI the way it is, this is impossible. Playing offline will guarantee police arriving within a minute and that would lead one to hope that the gunplay mechanics are at least decent. They are not. Besides the lack of reticle (which, ok I can live with but is odd given the hit confirmation reticle) the aiming moving and shooting are all pretty bad. Nothing horrendously wrong, but poor all round.On the issue of weapons however, it is impossible to pick up weapons from fallen cops and it's obvious that in order to enjoy a decent range of weapons you basically need to get the DLC. Now I have a $20 limit on games and this is NOT about to convince me to break that limit any time soon and with the current discounts I can justify some of the DLC which would allow me to make the game at least presentable. Wanting players to join the steam fanpage in order to unlock a bunch of basic gear is I feel rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a pretty low tactic to force people to be exposed to your promotions in exchange for making the one game they did buy semi-playable. A very DLC based experience and as such, a poor game.As for the levels, they're the same. I'll be doing a different job and running through the building on autopilot because I've seen it before except that the safe is in a different location now.And why does it keep updating? It feels like every time I start the game it needs to do an update. Games should never be updated, make an optional patch, and distribute bugfixes ASAP but any major overhauls save for the sequel.All in all, I'm hoping that once I play multipler with friends (the only reason I was told to get the game) it'll become somewhat good, but as far as going it solo to try and build up those skill points goes, it is a painful painful experience, not even worth the bandwidth to download the base game imho.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 14, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '98400', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""TL;DR below10 minutes in and I was bored, 30 minutes in and I was hooked.Hard Reset is no more or less than the quintessential old school shooter.

Enemies drop four kinds of drops: health (green), rifle ammo (red), plasma gun ammo (blue), and nano (orange). You also have a shield but it regenerates automatically. You collect enough nano and you earn an upgrade. Both of your weapons as well as your general gear upgrade the same way. Everything has 5 modes (the last two of which get unlocked later) and each mode has 2 additional upgrades beyond the first for a total of 15 upgrades for each weapon and your gear. For weapons this tends to mean a primary attack, and secondary function or attack, and a passive bonus in each of the 5 modes. Each weapon uses the same ammunition for each attack and each mode, albeit at different rates.Your environment is pretty dangerous, there are high explosives all over the place as well as electrified items which, when damaged, shock everything within range for a period of time before exploding. Additional from time to time you encounter random flame-throwers in the walls. You can take down entire waves of enemies with just the explosive and electric death traps lying around.That's basically it. That's the entire game (as far as I've played it anyway).On the down-side, the gun play isn't all that imaginative and you don't always have time to swap to all your cool new upgrades in the heat of battle. This combined with the high linearity, wave format of enemy encounters, terrible terrible voice acting and story (not that it has any real impact on the game), and the fact that, despite what the pictures look like above, the artistic style really isn't all that nice, makes me sort of sigh and dream of what this game could have been.IMHO, what this game could have been is Shadow Warrior (Redux), which I believe was a perfect and shining example of what happens when you put modern game technology and philosophy into an old school shooter. In a sense, Hard Reset is like a poor man's Shadow Warrior. Definitely not worth the same amount of money (I just picked up Hard Reset for like 2.50 USD, sooo not complaining). On the upside though, if you do like your old school shooters, this is a good game. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun, it's destructive, it's fast paced (during combat sequences), and you can just go insane. Ammo conservation hasn't been a problem yet (normal difficulty). Over all, I haven't found the game to be really difficult at all, which is not to say that I haven't died yet. Bottom line is, I'm enjoying it, I'd recommend it, and though I haven't played it enough to comment on the complaints about its short length, I'd say even at full cost (15 USD) I think it's fair.TL;DR : Solid game, proper old school shooter experience, no major faults besides ♥♥♥♥ story and acting, but nothing mind blowing either. I'd recommend it to friends.""}]",-0.9956

Valve has created quite a game with the long-awaited Team Fortress sequel, bearing many similarities to its predecessor, though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh. The most obvious aspect, which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted, is the visual style. Even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks, we\'re still amazed at the art design, both in how it looks and how it animates. But let\'s not get too carried away with the graphics. It\'s a game, after all, and the most important factor is how it plays and if it\'s entertaining. It\'s interesting to see both Team Fortress 2, which has been in development on and off for some seven years now, and Splash Damage\'s Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays, finally come out right around the same time. Their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you, the consumer, as to how to spend your cash. You may fondly remember your days in Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel. Yet you can\'t forget your days with Team Fortress Classic, or even further back with the original Team Fortress Quake mod, with its now painfully dated character models but compelling team-focused online play.  There\'s really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better. It\'s merely personal preference. Quake Wars is assuredly the more complicated game. For those uninitiated in the ways of Enemy Territory, the scope, dynamic objectives, speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens, and user interface can be rather daunting. After learning the ins and outs it\'s clearly an excellent product, but it lacks that immediate, irresistible appeal so prominent in Valve\'s Team Fortress 2. And accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer. Regardless, it\'s an excellent time to be a gamer, since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other, making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title. Like in Team Fortress Classic (TFC), Team Fortress 2 has nine character classes: Spy, Pyro, Soldier, Heavy, Medic, Sniper, Demoman, Scout and Engineer. Each class\' abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined, which, along with the graphics, is what makes Team Fortress 2 so much more accessible than TFC. No longer do you have Engineers running around with railguns and EMP grenades. Medics can\'t ""infect"" the other team, Spies don\'t have tranquilizer darts, and none of the classes have hand grenades. In TF2, each class has roughly three main ways of attacking - a primary weapon (the Heavy\'s minigun, Pyro\'s flamethrower, Engineer\'s sentry gun, etc.) and secondary (various classes have shotguns, others pistols, while the Demoman has a highly effective mine thrower) and melee weapons (the Scout\'s bat, the Medic\'s bonesaw, and so on). Though classes now possess fewer means of attacking, the resulting gameplay feels much more focused. Each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully. The only limiting factor is, of course, how effectively your team meshes together.  If your Engineers aren\'t guarding their structures, Spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges. If your team is full of Heavies and Soldiers but lacks Medics, you\'re not going to get very far. If you\'re playing a capture point map without any Scouts on your team, you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes. The Medic, though, seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels. For TF2 they\'ve been given a health hose, which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and ""sticks"" to them as long as you keep the fire button depressed. As you heal injured teammates, or ""overheal"" to 150 percent health, an ubercharge meter builds in the bottom right of the screen. Unleashing this renders both target and Medic invulnerable for a few seconds, which is sometimes the only way to break through chokepoints populated with Heavies, Medics, and multiple tier three sentry guns. Even though Medics may be the most vital to a team\'s success, the other classes remain useful. Scouts, who are now rather deadly, are far and away the fastest, and their ability to double-jump and change direction in mid-air makes then all the more difficult to hit. Spies, in addition to being able to one-hit kill backstab the enemy, cause general chaos among enemy ranks. If your opponents know a spy is running around, they\'ll waste time and lose focus by shooting at their own teammates to try and reveal a disguised culprit. Pyros tend to be the most effective spy detectors, and can be frequently seen doing fiery pirouettes in 2Fort matches all over the beta servers, as a spy incognito will betray his cover by bursting into flames upon contact with the burning spray.In a September 26 Steam update, friendly fire was removed from TF2, which was definitely a good move. Friendly fire ruins much of the game considering the close-quarters maps combined with the wide area of effect attacks of Heavies, Pyros, Demomen, and Soldiers. Without FF, teammates are free to shoot each other, since if they bleed health, they\'re a spy.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 31, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '319510', 'helpful': '3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Five Nights at Freddy\'s received positive reviews from critics. Indie Game Magazine praised Five Nights at Freddy\'s for its simple take on the horror genre, noting that its artistic direction and gameplay mechanics contributed to a feeling of ""brutal tension"" — worsened by how a player may be familiar with similar restaurants such as Chuck E. Cheese\'s, and that ""it\'s an incredibly terrifying experience to try to save yourself from the single jump scare that ends the game."" In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy\'s was considered a ""fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying."" However, the game was criticized for taking too long to load when launched.[1] Omri Petitte for PC Gamer gave Five Nights at Freddy\'s a score of 80 out of 100[2], commenting that the game took a ""less-is-more"" approach to its design, and that while ""the AI isn\'t some masterwork of procedural unpredictability,"" it would ""[still] head straight to you and eat your face off, or it\'ll play around like an innocent child before closing in for the kill. Your mind will fill in the rest."" The game\'s overall atmosphere was praised for emphasizing the fear and suspense of an approaching threat, rather than the arrival of the threat itself, as executed in other horror-oriented games. However, the gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy\'s was criticized for becoming repetitive once a player masters it, as there is ""not much more to expect beyond managing battery life and careful timing of slamming doors shut, so those with steely willpower won\'t find anything else past the atmosphere of it all."" Ryan Bates of Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5; comparing its camera-oriented gameplay to the 1992 game Night Trap, he praised the game\'s minimalistic presentation (with particular emphasis on its audio design and lack of music) for contributing to the terror of the game, along with the fact that the ""nervous impulses"" of its repetitive gameplay would ""[reach] almost OCD-type levels, adding to the tense environment."" In conclusion, he felt that the game was ""horror done right,"" but that it was too short. Eurogamer\'s Jeffrey Matulef compared the animatronic animals in the game to Weeping Angels — predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who — due to their ability to only move when they are not being observed.[3] Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it ""drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles,"" but that the ""inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their \'love\' with you.""[4] '}, {'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted August 20, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited August 30, 2015.', 'item_id': '388090', 'helpful': '3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""The tensest moment in Five Nights at Freddy s 4 is a one-second lean. I m leaning out of a child s bedroom, a sharp departure from the Formica wasteland of Freddy Fazbear s pizzeria, peering down a hallway swallowed in darkness. I may as well be staring into a lion s mouth. When I risk a glance out one of the two flanking doors into the dark corridors beyond, my perspective skews unnervingly. I can imagine my hands hugging the wall, an ostensible anchor against the nightmares bumping in the blackness.Nothing jumps out at me this time. The moment passes, and it's back to the same movements and mouse-clicks I ve repeated dozens of times before. I should ve yawned five minutes ago, but soon I m once more forcing my heart back down my throat for my next peek outside. This repeats for quite some minutes. If FNAF 4 needed a box blurb, it d read something like a rollercoaster of apprehension.FNAF 4 s composition is another rivet in the series steel-clad design which immortalized its Let s Play legacy in a few short months: five 8-minute nights of staying put in a room while fending off a quick death (and a nasty jumpscare) from creepy, walking animatronic animals using careful surveillance and snappily blocking access to whatever shuffles close. Loud screeches and terrifying robotic visages are common, so a strong resolve helps. Mostly.Boy meets demonAbove anything, developer Scott Cawthon s tenacity at constantly tweaking his formula for horror is almost Kubrickian in its meticulousness. FNAF 4 s fundamentals stay firmly acquainted—a familiarly symmetrical room; the reprise of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy as primary antagonists; the usage of doors as a primary defensive mechanic—but its differences offer a refreshing new presentation of the risk-reward seesaw of its predecessors.Replacing the ever-troubled pizzeria from previous games is the nighttime bedroom of a kid who both substitutes for the hilariously underpaid security guard as the main character and clearly establishes his traumatic phobia of Freddy s friends with a constant Binding-of-Isaac-esque flow of tears. In a flagrant flouting of the status quo, the camera system is removed entirely. Checking for an impending attack involves running up to a door, leaning out, and clicking on a flashlight (thankfully with unlimited battery power) or slamming the door shut at the precise moment I anticipate something lunging for me.As before, staying alive demands familiarization with each animatronic s behavior. Where sight and constant camera tracking facilitated this in earlier games, FNAF 4 tosses that away for a different angle: sound. Audio cues—muffled footsteps, the metallic tinkling of shifting kitchen pans, a huff of breath from something Right Beside You—indicate when to use the flashlight or seal a doorway. Being proactive is essential; a single mistake invariably delivers a booming fright. I liked that avoidance of randomness in failure, as my actions and choices solely contributed to whether or not I d soon jump out of my chair.And that s really what Cawthon is best at: ensuring crystallized snapshots of stomach-dropping terror. FNAF 4 uses the sensitivity of your senses to prod out a panicked yelp every time. Does it work? Absolutely. It s absurdly rudimentary: straining to hear something barely above a whisper connects into a skull-shaking blast of sound and a horrible monster face stretched across the monitor. Of course it works.A minigame involving a plushified version of Springtrap can shave two hours off each night.But it s a bit worrisome to see an overall pivot away from what made the series so attractive in favor of a single, static mechanical loop across all five nights. The camera system, although imperfect—as later nights grew more difficult, staring too long at the video screen likely meant death—greatly defined the series identity. In FNAF 2, checking vents and winding the music box were integral counterparts to the cameras. FNAF 3 piled on the sinister inevitability of tracking a stalking killer.In many ways, the Five Nights games require a certain respect for their atmospheric lore, a twisted menagerie of cloudy dates, murder mysteries, and inter-relationships nearly as spaghettified as a Metal Gear Solid cutscene. Stepping into Freddy s world, like flipping open a King novel or tuning into a Carpenter classic, is an investment in putting aside disbelief and reveling in the supernatural guesswork of the genre. That s sadly tougher to pull off in Five Nights at Freddy s 4; the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over—door, listen, flashlight, repeat—is too much of a chore to fully pull me in. It s certainly the scariest of the four, but the subtle uneasiness and self-doubt so tellingly accomplished in its older brothers is diminished.""}, {'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted July 30, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '304930', 'helpful': '2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '...'}]",-0.9907

When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.""}]",-0.8235
